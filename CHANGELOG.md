## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Replay evaluation: the production triage path, run over a customer's own
  closed findings, writing nothing** (gap-closure Phase 1.2 and 1.3). Phase
  1.1 made an operator's analyst labels readable. Nothing could grade against
  them, and the obvious way to build that grading is the wrong one: a second
  triage implementation would measure the evaluation harness rather than the
  product, and would diverge from it the first time anybody changed a prompt.

  **The gap, and how it was closed.** `FusedAlertTriageWorker.triage` could
  not run without writing. It recorded the verdict to the Investigation
  Ledger and the `alerts` row, wrote a per-signature outcome prior, queued
  approvals, cached the verdict for deduplication and pushed the disposition
  back to the source SIEM, all inline. Persistence is now injected through
  `app/workers/triage_persistence.py`: `LiveTriageWriter` is the default and
  does exactly what the worker used to do, and `ShadowTriageWriter` counts
  each call and performs none of them. There is no `if replay` on the hot
  path, so there is nothing to drift. `CostTracker` grew a `persist` flag for
  the same reason: a replay must measure spend and must not bill it.

  **Point-in-time context, because the test window must not answer itself.**
  Production writes every verdict back as an outcome prior and reads that
  prior *before* triage, so in a naive replay the verdict on one finding
  auto-closes the next finding with the same evidence and the evaluation
  grades an answer it supplied itself. The deduplication cache does the same
  thing one layer earlier and leaves no trace in either store. Organisation
  memory and outcome priors are now captured once at the 70/30 time split and
  served from that snapshot for the whole run, and rows recorded after the
  split are dropped from it.

  **Scoring extends `packages/aisoc-benchmark` rather than standing beside
  it.** The hallucination machinery is the existing
  `_INDICATOR_PATTERNS`, so an indicator counted here is one the synthetic
  corpus grader would also count. New: per-class precision and recall with
  malicious recall first, a confusion matrix, abstention rate, reliability
  bins with an expected calibration error, per-rule and per-source
  breakdowns, and seeded bootstrap confidence intervals. Below 30 malicious
  cases the report prints the count and refuses a headline accuracy, because
  on a queue that is almost entirely false positives an agent that calls
  everything benign scores well and the figure would describe the queue. A
  rate with no denominator reads "not measured", never 0.

  **Measured:** the `services/agents` suite goes from 1252 to 1280 passing,
  `packages/aisoc-benchmark` from 35 to 57, and `services/connectors` from
  880 to 886. Two runs of a 20-finding replay on the deterministic tier
  produce identical decisions on every field but wall-clock latency, and two
  renderings of one score are byte-identical.

  **Gates:** `ci.yml` agents job (`test_replay_shadow_no_writes.py`,
  `test_replay_leakage.py`), `ci.yml` benchmark job
  (`test_replay_metrics.py`), and a new
  `scripts/check_replay_contract_parity.py` wired into `ci.yml`, which
  compares the finding shape and the disposition taxonomy across the three
  trees that hold them and cannot import one another, in both directions. The
  leakage tests each carry a sensitivity half that runs the unprotected
  configuration and asserts it leaks, so the file cannot go quietly green
  over a property it has stopped testing. Three claim-to-gate rows; the
  matrix goes 148 rows to 151, GATED 140 to 143, NO GATE stays 0.

- **File and URL analysis behind one provider contract, with uploading a
  customer file off by default.** AiSOC could enrich an IP, a domain and a URL
  and had nothing at all for a file hash: `services/enrichment` fans out to
  five threat-intel providers, none of which analyses a file, and the phishing
  triage route read an attachment's name and never its contents. The gap was
  measured by reading the tree, not estimated: no module under `services/`
  contained the words sandbox, detonation or CAPE in an executable sense, and
  `AlertEnricher._IOC_FIELDS` mapped `file_hash` to the same generic lookup as
  an IP.

  `SandboxProvider` covers hash lookup, file submission, URL submission,
  polling and a report. The interface owns the vocabulary (a verdict, a score
  0-100, signatures, IOCs and an ATT&CK mapping) and each provider maps its
  own payload onto it, so the first adapter wired does not become the de-facto
  schema. Three ship: **CAPEv2** as the open-source reference, which runs on
  the operator's own network and is therefore the one that survives air-gapped
  mode; a **mock** that analyses nothing and knows nothing until a test seeds
  it; and **MalwareAnalyzer** as the first commercial adapter.

  **Absent is not zero, and this is the field that proved it necessary.** A
  recorded MalwareAnalyzer report carries `attackTechniques: []` beside
  `behavior.analyzed: false`. The list is empty because the file type could
  not be identified and no guest was ever chosen, not because the sample
  exhibits no techniques. An `UNAVAILABLE` sentinel keeps "the provider does
  not compute this" distinct from "the provider computed it and found none",
  and the report carries the stage's own reason so an analyst asking why a
  section is blank gets an answer instead of a guess. A missing score reads
  `unavailable`, never `0`.

  **Uploading is a disclosure and is modelled as a decision.** Hash lookup runs
  first, always, because a digest discloses nothing and a hit means the upload
  is unnecessary rather than forbidden. Uploading is then off by default, per
  tenant *and* per provider, since consenting to a sandbox in your own rack says
  nothing about a hosted service. It is recorded with who agreed and which version
  of the disclosure text they saw, and refused outright in air-gapped mode for
  any provider that is not local. Migration `064` adds both tables with
  row-level security, the fail-open arm the cross-tenant workers need, and
  `aisoc_app` grants. Refusals are logged as well as uploads, because "nothing
  was uploaded, the hash was already known" and "nothing was uploaded, this
  tenant has not consented" are the two answers an operator actually needs.

  **The consent text says `public` because the service does.** A stored
  MalwareAnalyzer report carries `visibility: "public"` and `tlp: "clear"`, so
  an upload there is a disclosure to the internet rather than to a vendor. The
  operator-facing text says so in those words. The vendor's own web client
  sends a `visibility` field and offers `private`, but pins `public` and
  disables the control without a signed-in account, so AiSOC requests the
  configured visibility and keeps describing the outcome as public until an
  operator sets `MALWAREANALYZER_PRIVATE_SUBMISSIONS_CONFIRMED=1`. A key alone
  does not flip that wording: an unverified assumption must not rewrite the
  sentence somebody agrees to before disclosing a customer file.

  **Authentication is supported and labelled unverified, because it could not
  be determined.** The service publishes "No API key required" and every call
  works without one. There is an authenticated surface, and the vendor's client
  sends `Authorization: Bearer`, which is why that is the default here. But a
  bogus `Bearer` and a bogus `x-api-key` produce byte-identical `401`s and the
  CORS preflight reflects any header asked for, so neither confirms the scheme
  for a minted key. The header name and prefix are configurable, no key is
  required, and the provider reports `authentication_is_verified = False` so
  the settings surface shows a caveat rather than a tick nobody earned.

  **A failure reaches the model as "could not check".** A provider that times
  out, refuses authentication or returns something unparseable produces
  `outcome: could_not_check` with the reason attached and no report at all. A
  pending analysis is equally distinct from a clean one. The agent gets one
  tool, `lookup_file_hash`, which cannot upload: an upload is governed by a
  consent an operator recorded deliberately, and that decision does not belong
  behind a sentence a model chose to emit.

  Wired into file-hash enrichment, into `POST /phishing/submit` via
  `attachment_hashes` (digests only, for the same reason), and into the agent
  tool registry.

  Gated by `scripts/check_sandbox_upload_policy.py` in `ci.yml`, which drives
  the real policy over all 24 combinations of provider class, air-gap, consent
  and hash-known, requires air-gap and a known hash to each outrank consent,
  and reads the AST for the three shapes that would make those runtime checks
  vacuous: a consent-shaped flag defaulting to `True`, `evaluate_upload` called
  before `lookup_hash`, and an `except` block constructing a report. It was
  proven against an injected violation of each rule rather than only against
  the tree that satisfies them, and it refuses a tree with no content.

  No file was uploaded to any third party while building this. The recorded
  fixture is a GET by hash for the published EICAR test file; every
  submit and poll fixture is hand-written and labelled as such.

- **Closed-finding history readers: the analyst labels a replay evaluation
  grades against** (gap-closure Phase 1.1). AiSOC could already push a verdict
  into somebody else's SIEM. It could not read back the findings a customer's
  own analysts had already closed, so there was no way for an operator to
  measure triage against their own decisions on their own data before being
  asked to trust it. The published benchmark is substrate self-consistency on
  a synthetic corpus, which answers a different question.

  Five readers now list closed findings in a time window, each row carrying
  the analyst's disposition, their reason, who closed it and when:
  `SplunkClient.list_closed_notables`, `SentinelClient.list_closed_incidents`,
  `ElasticClient.list_closed_signals`, `QRadarClient.list_closed_offenses` and
  `DefenderClient.list_resolved_alerts`. They extend the clients in
  `services/actions`, which already own the credential path and already hold
  the writeback going the other way.

  **The rule that carries the value is the refusal to guess.** Vendor labels
  map to the canonical taxonomy in one place,
  `app/services/alert_history.py`, rather than five places that could disagree
  about what "benign positive" means. Anything outside that taxonomy becomes
  `unlabeled` and is excluded from accuracy. That is not an edge case: Splunk
  ES ships dispositions literally named "Other" and "Undetermined", and
  Sentinel and Defender both ship an explicit `Undetermined` or `Unknown`
  classification. An analyst who picked one of those said they did not know,
  and folding it into `true_positive` because the finding happened to be
  closed would manufacture agreement out of an admission of uncertainty.

  Two vendor-specific decisions are worth stating rather than burying.
  Elastic Security ships no disposition field at all: closing a signal records
  no reason, so the honest reader returns `unlabeled` unless the deployment
  has adopted a workflow tag, and the convention it reads is documented rather
  than assumed. QRadar's "Non-Issue" maps to `benign` and not
  `benign_true_positive`, because it makes no claim about whether the rule was
  right, which is the distinction `benign` exists to carry.

  **Measured:** 30 new tests drive each reader's real HTTP path against
  vendor-shaped payloads with a mock transport, so a wrong endpoint, a wrong
  filter or a parser that fails on the documented response shape is caught
  here rather than on a customer's history. The `services/actions` suite goes
  from 737 to 767 passing.

  **Gate:** `ci.yml` actions job (`test_alert_history.py`), with a new
  claim-to-gate row. The assertions that hold the claim are the negative ones:
  every vendor's explicit "I do not know" is asserted to land on `unlabeled`,
  two conflicting Elastic tags yield `unlabeled` rather than a coin flip, and
  `unlabeled` is asserted not to be a member of `CANONICAL_DISPOSITIONS` so
  nothing downstream can score it as a verdict. `ClosedFinding.__post_init__`
  refuses a disposition that is neither canonical nor `unlabeled`, so a mapper
  cannot introduce a third vocabulary. An unparseable close time raises rather
  than defaulting to now, because a silently wrong close time would put a row
  on the wrong side of the train/test split and leak the answer into its own
  evaluation.

## [11.2.0] — 2026-09-26

### Added

- **The detection engine runs 2,603 rules instead of 833, and every one of the
  1,770 added rules has been watched to fire.** The library has held roughly
  7,000 ATT&CK-mapped rules for months while 833 executed, and the question
  that prompted this — why 800 and not 5,000 — turned out to have a single
  concrete answer rather than a missing feature.

  **Windows telemetry was unreachable, and nothing said so.** The engine
  flattens `raw_event`'s top level into the namespace the matcher reads, and
  the matcher does a plain `event.get(field)` with no path traversal. A Windows
  event puts its payload one level below that: `CommandLine` lives at
  `raw_event.EventData.CommandLine`, `EventID` under `System`. Those are the
  two most-used fields in the public Sigma corpus — `CommandLine` in 2,173
  rules and `Image` in 2,300 — so every Windows rule read `None` on its first
  clause and could not fire however correctly it was written.
  `windows_event.normalize()` now lifts both containers, which is where the
  fix belongs: `System` and `EventData` are names from the Windows event
  schema, and the engine is shared by every connector. Nothing in the engine or
  the matcher changed, so the blast radius on the existing 833 is nil — proven
  by replaying all 1,756 committed fixtures and confirming every native rule
  keeps its verdict, now a standing test rather than a one-off check.

  **`scripts/sigma_compiler.py` translates imported Sigma into `match_when`, or
  refuses.** Refusal is the design. Sigma compares strings case-insensitively
  and several matcher operators do not, so equality and affix tests compile to
  anchored `pattern_match_any` rather than to `endswith_any`, which would have
  silently stopped matching `\SvcHost.exe`. Sigma's `not filter` is true when
  the field is missing, and only `not_in` and `not_contains_any` behave that
  way, so the other negations are refused rather than narrowed. Of 3,132
  imported rules, 1,770 ship and 1,362 are refused with a recorded reason — the
  largest being 556 whose log source no connector emits and 464 whose negation
  would flip on a missing field. The full taxonomy is in
  `docs/detections/sigma-compilation.md`.

  **A rule ships only after it is seen to fire.** `check_detection_fields.py`
  says in its own docstring that it over-approximates and that "a false pass is
  a rule this gate should have caught", so passing it is not evidence.
  `scripts/compile_sigma_ruleset.py` replays a vendor-shaped event through the
  **real** connector `normalize()` and the **real** `DetectionEngine`, and
  keeps the rule only if it produces a hit and stays silent on an empty event
  of the same shape. The proof is that the rule is reachable and fires on a
  well-formed event of its log source — not that it detects an attack, which
  no gate here claims. `--prove-gate` reverts the connector to its pre-fix
  behaviour and requires all 1,687 Windows rules to stop firing, so the proof
  is known to be capable of failing.

- **Eight windowed aggregation rules**, covering the detection family the
  quarantine index had been telling contributors to skip. Windows now
  contributes here too: failed-logon volume per host, password spray counted by
  distinct account rather than by attempt, service-install and scheduled-task
  bursts, remote-thread fan-out, and per-process DNS fan-out for tunnelling
  and domain-generation algorithms.

- **`scripts/measure_triage_reliability.py`** — the measurement behind the
  auto-triage reliability figures under *Fixed* below. It imports the
  production prompt, envelope and parser rather than restating them, and uses a
  *different* alert per attempt: production pins `temperature=0.0`, so asking
  one alert twenty times measures one reply twenty times, not a rate. Failed
  attempts record the model's own words, since "Expecting value: line 4 column
  16" cannot be diagnosed without the text it indexes into. With no model
  reachable it prints SKIPPED and says that nothing was measured, because a
  skip is not a pass.

### Changed

- **Nothing an operator has to do, but the detection surface is 3.1x wider.**
  There is no configuration change, no migration and no API change in this
  release — the connector fix lifts the `System` and `EventData` containers
  into the namespace the matcher already read, and a connector-normalized key
  still wins on collision, so it only adds fields. What does change is that
  2,603 rules evaluate where 833 did, and 1,687 of the additions are Windows
  rules that could never fire before, so a deployment with Windows telemetry
  should expect more alerts from the same stream. Every imported rule carries
  its `upstream_status` onto the alert, so the 125 `experimental` ones can be
  filtered without disabling the rest.

- **Upstream lifecycle status no longer decides whether an imported rule runs.**
  The importer quarantined on SigmaHQ status, which put 2,844 `test` and 211
  `experimental` rules behind a flag. That conflated whether a rule *can
  execute here* with how confident its authors are in its content; only the
  first was ever the blocker. In SigmaHQ, `test` means reviewed and in
  community use — the normal state for most of the corpus, not a warning.
  Fireability now gates, status is carried onto the rule and the alert so it
  can still be filtered, and `deprecated`/`unsupported` are refused outright.

- **Published counts lead with the library and always name the executable
  figure beside it** — "6,991 rules on disk, 2,603 executable". The two travel
  together because a library figure on its own reads as coverage. 6,991 rather
  than the 7,016 files under `detections/`, because 25 of those are playbooks.

### Fixed

- **76 rules were marked enabled and the engine had never heard of them.** They
  counted as shipped coverage and detected nothing: 44 native rules authored as
  YAML with no Python spec (the YAML is a generated projection, so the engine
  never reads it), 31 imported Sigma rules, and 1 community rule. 46 of the
  original 122 became executable through the compiler; the rest are now
  `enabled: false` with a `quarantine_reason` naming what each would need. They
  were deliberately not translated: their fields have no known emitter, so
  making them load would have added rules that cannot fire, which is the defect
  being removed rather than progress against it.
  `detection_truth_table.py --check` now fails on any such rule.

- **`readme_gates.py` misread a formatted figure.** Its pattern stopped at the
  thousands separator, so "2,603 executable" was compared as 603 — a gate
  measuring a number the README never claimed.

- **The quarantine index told translators to skip the largest untranslated
  family in it.** Step 3 said `| stats` aggregations belong in the windowed
  engine, "which today has three hardcoded rules and no loader. Skip those
  until it has one." `load_window_rules()` reads `windowed_ruleset.json` and
  `main.py` wires it on by default, so the instruction had been stale for some
  time while continuing to steer people away from roughly half the Splunk
  quarantine. Corrected in `scripts/build_quarantine_index.py`, since the
  README is generated output and editing the file would have regenerated the
  error — the same shape as the detection-coverage generator that kept
  restoring a dead link after the page was fixed.

- **Auto-triage never asked the provider for JSON, so a third of the bundled
  model's replies were thrown away.** `run_auto_triage` parses the reply as a
  JSON object, but nothing in `services/agents/app/llm/` ever set
  `response_format`, leaving the model free to emit prose shaped like JSON and
  the parser to correct it afterwards. Measured over 50 alerts from the
  committed synthetic corpus, through the LiteLLM gateway exactly as production
  routes, against the bundled `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` at the production
  `temperature=0.0` / `max_tokens=512`: replies triage could use went from
  **44 of 50 to 50 of 50** once the reply was constrained to a JSON object.

  The failure shape is worth recording, because it was not the one expected.
  **Every one of the six failures carried a correct `verdict` and `confidence`
  and a malformed `rationale`** — `"rationale": The alert is...` with the
  opening quote simply missing, a raw newline before an unquoted value, or an
  invalid `\'` escape. `finish_reason` was `stop` on all 50 calls, so
  truncation was not involved and `max_tokens` is exonerated. A model that had
  reasoned correctly was being discarded over its punctuation, which is
  precisely what constraining the grammar prevents and no amount of parsing
  after the fact can.

  The gateway ships `drop_params: true`, so a provider that does not support
  the parameter has it dropped rather than erroring. Requested through
  `model_kwargs` rather than as a top-level argument, because langchain warns
  on every construction otherwise.

- **The published "7 of 19" reliability figure does not reproduce.** Re-measured
  on the production call path at the sample sizes above, the pre-fix tree reads
  44 of 50. The original number's conditions are not recoverable — it was taken
  during a QA run whose host had exhausted its disk — so rather than restate it,
  `scripts/measure_triage_reliability.py` now produces the figure repeatably and
  records *why* each failed attempt failed. Every surface that published the old
  ratio now carries the new one and names the method.

- **A valid verdict was discarded when one field had the wrong type.**
  `float(data.get("confidence", 0.5))` was unguarded, so `"confidence": "high"`
  raised `ValueError`, which the caller converts into an `AutoTriageError` and a
  deterministic fallback — losing a verdict and rationale that may have been
  perfectly good. `_coerce_confidence` now reads numeric strings and
  percentages and degrades to a neutral 0.5 otherwise. That is safe here and
  only here: auto-close requires `confidence >= AUTO_CLOSE_THRESHOLD` (0.85 by
  default), so an unread field escalates to a human instead of closing an
  alert. The verdict itself still fails closed. Not a cause of the measured
  failures, but reachable by any model on any alert.

- **`structured_output.py` described itself as the single fail-closed parser
  while nothing in production imported it.** Its docstring said each agent
  "had its own ad-hoc `_parse_llm_response`", past tense; all five still did,
  and its only callers were its own tests — a passing test on an uncalled
  function is indistinguishable from a working feature. `auto_triage_agent` now
  shares its extraction step, and the docstring records that `cloud_agent`,
  `identity_agent`, `insider_threat_agent` and `phishing_agent` still carry
  their own, rather than describing the consolidation as finished.

  Extracting is also now brace-balanced and string-aware. It trimmed prose
  before the opening `{` and nothing after the closing `}`, so a model that
  answered correctly and added "Hope that helps!" was scored unparseable — and
  a `}` inside a string value would have ended the scan early. An unclosed
  object is still handed to the JSON parser to report rather than silently
  trimmed to the last balanced point, because extraction may read what the
  model said and must not guess at what it meant.

- **Three counters still classified rules by their directory, and disagreed
  with the engine by about 1,700 each.** `_quarantine/` stopped meaning "cannot
  run" when the Sigma compiler began translating rules where they sat, and the
  tools that had not been moved to the compiled ruleset kept reporting the old
  world while printing OK. `validate_detections.py` published "Quarantined
  (parsed-but-disabled): 5937" against a truth table saying 4,213 about the
  same tree; it now reports `Executable (loaded by the engine): 2603; not
  loaded: 4388`, read from the same artefact, so the two cannot diverge.
  `curate_detections.py` skipped every `_quarantine/` file before scoring, so
  the published coverage page selected from 1,054 candidates out of 2,603
  executable rules and its "By category" list contained a category named
  `_quarantine`; candidates are now the rules the engine loads, and a rule
  that cannot fire is no longer eligible for a page that promises coverage.

- **`build_marketplace.py` published 7,016 detections against a README and a
  truth table that both say 6,991.** The 25-rule gap was `detections/playbooks/`
  — response playbooks with `trigger:` and `steps:` and no `detection:` block —
  walked as native detections because `playbooks` was missing from the skip set
  that `detection_truth_table.py` has always carried. They are indexed as
  playbooks now, so the marketplace keeps all 7,155 items, `stats.detections`
  reads 6,991, and the landing page's pack figure is unaffected: `stats.playbooks`
  counts every playbook and a new `stats.playbook_packs` counts the v1 pack
  alone, because 62 of the 87 are packs and calling all 87 packs would have
  traded one wrong number for another.

- **Five refusal reasons rendered as broken table rows.** The Sigma compilation
  report escapes the example it prints and not the reason, and five reasons
  *name a Sigma modifier* — `|re`, `|cidr`, `|all`, `|base64`, `|fieldref` —
  whose leading pipe is also a Markdown cell delimiter, so each opened an empty
  first column and shifted its row. The rows that rendered wrong were exactly
  the ones explaining the least obvious refusals.

- **The DRL-1.1 attribution gap is now stated in the report rather than
  discoverable only from the JSON.** `provenance.author` is empty on all 1,770
  compiled rules because the Sigma importer never read the upstream `author:`
  field. Attribution travels as repository, upstream rule id, upstream path and
  licence — enough to find the rule, not enough to name who wrote it. The engine
  builds its attribution sentence from what the block holds, so an alert reads
  short rather than crediting an author called `""`, but a licence obligation
  that is partly met is not met. Closing it needs a re-import.


## [11.1.0] — 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **The console's API and realtime addresses are now read when the container
  starts, so a deployment that is not a laptop can be pointed at its own
  services.** Reported by a self-hoster bringing AiSOC up with Compose on a
  single host: setting the documented variables changed nothing. It could not
  have — `next build` freezes *both* halves of the console's routing. Anything
  prefixed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is inlined into the JavaScript bundle as a string
  literal, and the destinations returned by `rewrites()` in `next.config.js`
  are compiled into `.next/routes-manifest.json`. `next start` loads the
  config again and logs that it did, which makes this look configurable, but
  production routing is served from the manifest. A pulled image could
  therefore only ever talk to the hosts it was built against.

  It worked on the bundled Compose stack by coincidence: the baked
  `http://api:8000` happens to be that service's DNS name on that network.
  Any other topology resolved a hostname that does not exist, and no variable
  could re-point it.

  `apps/web/docker-entrypoint.sh` now re-evaluates `rewrites()` against the
  container's environment and writes the result into the manifest before the
  server starts. `next.config.js` stays the single definition of the routing
  table — the resolver duplicates no route — so `AISOC_API_URL`,
  `AISOC_AGENTS_URL` and `AISOC_REALTIME_URL` take effect on a pulled image
  with no rebuild. An address that is set and cannot be applied stops the
  container and names itself rather than starting on the built-in defaults,
  because a console silently pointed at the wrong host is worse than one that
  refuses to boot.

  The browser needs no absolute URL at all and did not need one before: the
  bundle calls same-origin paths and this server forwards them, which is why
  one image works on `localhost`, on a LAN address and behind a reverse proxy,
  and why there is no CORS surface to configure. `docker-compose.yml` no
  longer sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` on the `web`
  service, where they were read by nothing while looking like the knob an
  operator was meant to turn.

- **A single-host deployment can be reached.** Every host port published to a
  literal `127.0.0.1`, so the stack came up healthy and nothing outside the
  machine could reach it — including the browser it was meant to be used from
  — and nothing in `.env` could change that. `AISOC_CONSOLE_BIND_ADDR`
  publishes the console, and `AISOC_BIND_ADDR` moves every binding for an
  isolated network. Both default to loopback, so a laptop install still
  exposes nothing by omission.

  The console gets its own knob because same-origin proxying means one port is
  enough: exposing AiSOC to a LAN no longer means handing out Postgres, Redis,
  Kafka and Neo4j with the development passwords this repository ships.

- **The Helm chart pointed the console at hostnames that do not exist in a
  cluster.** It set no upstream addresses on the web Deployment at all, while
  the published image dials `http://api:8000`; the chart's Services are
  `<release>-api`, `<release>-agents` and `<release>-realtime`. Every console
  request resolved nowhere, so the page loaded and every panel stayed empty.
  The three addresses are now derived from the release's own Services, and
  `services.web.env` overrides them for an API outside the release. This needs
  a console image carrying the runtime entrypoint above; an older image
  ignores them.

- **Demo mode has one authoritative answer, and it is visible.** Two flags
  decided it and neither could be reconciled from outside the container:
  `AISOC_DEMO_MODE` gated the API's seed at run time while the console read
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE`, compiled in at build time. The two could disagree,
  and `AppShell` wrapped the banner in `ClientOnly` to hide the resulting
  React hydration error rather than remove its cause. `AISOC_DEMO_MODE` now
  answers for both services and outranks the compiled value, the Server
  Component in `app/(app)/layout.tsx` resolves it once and hands it down so
  the two paints cannot differ, and `GET /api/runtime-config` reports the
  answer with the source that produced it (`runtime`, `build` or `default`)
  plus the version the image was built from. Checking whether a deployment
  thinks it is a demo no longer means inferring it from the rendered page —
  which was actively misleading, because the banner copy is an inlined
  constant present in the HTML either way.

- **The console image a self-hoster pulls now tracks `main`, and a release
  that publishes only some of its images now fails.** The fix above shipped to
  nobody: `ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-web:latest` — what the documented
  `docker compose up` pulls — was built from a commit two releases behind
  `main`, and `aisoc-web:v11.0.0` was never pushed at all while
  `aisoc-core-api`, `aisoc-fusion` and `aisoc-ingest` all carried that tag.
  Every workflow was green throughout, which is the whole problem: a green
  workflow says a job ran, not that the registry holds anything.

  The cause was arm64 cross-building under QEMU on an amd64 runner. Measured
  from BuildKit's own step timings in the v11.0.0 release run, emulation cost
  roughly 7x on a good run — `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` 15.0s on amd64
  against 114.2s on arm64, the Next.js build 45.0s against 281.6s — and on a
  bad run it did not converge at all: that release's arm64 `pnpm install` ran
  **6,358 seconds without finishing**, 56x its own normal time, while the
  amd64 leg of the identical build completed in 100s. The slow step is the
  dependency install rather than the compile, so it was never a Next.js
  problem, and it is intermittent rather than a steady cost — the same build
  succeeded in five minutes on another runner while that one was still stuck.

  Both `publish-images.yml` and `release.yml` now build each architecture on a
  runner of that architecture and merge the two into a manifest list, so the
  emulator is gone rather than budgeted for. arm64 itself stays: Apple Silicon
  is the majority of contributor laptops, and an amd64-only manifest turns the
  quickstart into a long silent build there. Every leg pushes by digest and
  the tags are attached once, after both exist, so `:latest` can no longer
  resolve to half a manifest.

  `publish-images.yml` also no longer cancels itself. `cancel-in-progress` is
  thrift on a test run and a correctness bug on a run that pushes artefacts —
  it is what left twelve images at the new commit and the thirteenth two
  behind, reported as `cancelled` rather than `failed`. Runs now queue. And
  `release.yml` gained a `workflow_dispatch` that republishes the images for
  an existing tag, because the only way to finish a half-published release was
  previously to invent a new tag for a commit that had already shipped.

- **A republish moved `latest` to the older release it was repairing, and
  stamped the wrong commit on every image it built.** Both come from the same
  place: on a dispatched run the GitHub context describes the ref the workflow
  was launched from while the source checked out is the tag being
  republished. So `metadata-action` wrote `main`'s commit into
  `org.opencontainers.image.revision` on images built from v11.0.0 — the field
  `check_published_images.py` trusts to decide what an image contains — and
  the tag list still carried `latest`, which handed eight images older content
  than `main` on the tag a self-hoster pulls by default. A republish now
  publishes only the tag it was asked to repair, and labels the commit it
  actually built. Its verification step also checks out the workflow's own ref
  rather than the tag, because the gate it runs exists on the default branch
  and not in a tree from two releases ago.

- **A dispatched release reported success having published nothing.** The
  recovery path's `release` job is push-only, and a skip propagates the whole
  length of a `needs` chain rather than one link: `docker-build` declared
  `always()` and ran, `docker-manifest` declared nothing and was skipped
  anyway. The first dispatched run built both architectures of sixteen images,
  tagged none of them, and went green — the same silent green the workflow was
  being changed to fix. Every job below the conditional one now says
  `always()` and states what it requires, and
  `test_no_job_below_a_conditional_one_is_silently_skipped` walks the `needs`
  graph of both workflows so the shape cannot return.

- **The console's manifest job collected the demo build's digests as well as
  its own.** `web` and `web-demo` push to the same repository and the digest
  artefacts were keyed `digest-<service>-<platform>`, downloaded with a
  `digest-<service>-*` pattern — so `digest-web-*` also matched
  `digest-web-demo-amd64`, and the console's merge job pulled four digests,
  two of them the demo bundle. It failed on the merge step's own check that it
  had exactly one digest per architecture, which is the only reason a mixed
  manifest did not go out under the tag `make up` pulls. The separator is now
  a dot, which cannot collide, and `test_one_image_cannot_collect_another_images_digests`
  replays each service's download pattern against every service's upload name
  so the ambiguity is caught at review rather than at publish.

- **`aisoc-honeytokens`, `aisoc-purple-team` and `aisoc-osquery-tls` are
  published.** All three were named by `docker-compose.yml` since it was
  written and built by nothing, so `--profile extras` silently compiled them
  from source every time. The Helm chart has no such fallback and named two of
  them, so those pods could only ever have reached `ImagePullBackOff`.

- **The Helm chart could not install at all.** Every image tag defaults to
  `Chart.AppVersion`, which read `5.2.0` — a tag that exists for no image in
  the registry — so a default `helm install` would have failed to pull on
  every pod. It now pins a tag that exists. The chart also named
  `ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-alert-fusion`, which has never existed under any tag;
  the image the publish matrix builds is `aisoc-fusion`.

- **Deployment docs named four images that have never been published.**
  `deployment/kubernetes.md` listed seven images at `v5.2.0` — including
  `aisoc-api` and `aisoc-mcp`, neither of which exists under any tag — and its
  `helm install` passed `--set api.image.tag=…`, a path no template reads,
  since every service lives under `services.<name>`. The overrides therefore
  changed nothing and the tag they set existed for nothing. `deployment/
  docker.md`, the Vault connector page, and the Azure and GCP Terraform
  defaults — the `api_image` variable a `terraform apply` uses, which pointed
  at `aisoc-api` — named the same non-existent images. The gate now
  resolves fully-written first-party references in tracked prose too —
  existence only, since a release note naming an older image is describing
  history rather than instructing anybody.

- **`make up` printed an address the operator could not use.** README tells
  anyone deploying to something other than a laptop to set `AISOC_CONSOLE_URL`
  "so the printed address is the one people browse to", and `up` printed a
  hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` regardless. Two lines below it
  `bootstrap` printed the configured address, because it reads the variable —
  so the operator got both, contradicting each other, wrong one first, on the
  one screen where they are being handed a credential and told where to use
  it. On a host reached by its LAN address `localhost` resolves on the
  reader's own machine to something that is not that console. Both `up` and
  `up-full` now derive the line from `.env`, falling back to
  `http://localhost:3000` when it is unset, so a laptop install is unchanged.
  The `API:` line beside it stays on loopback deliberately: that is accurate
  for this host, and a console URL behind a reverse proxy says nothing about
  where the API port ended up, so deriving one from the other would trade a
  wrong address for a guess.

- **`make doctor` reported another deployment's health as yours.** Its port
  section derives each host port from `docker compose port`, so it correctly
  says "aisoc api is published on 18000 (not the default 8000)". Its service
  probes then dialled the canonical port anyway. On a host running a second
  AiSOC project that means probing the other project's containers: observed
  here as `ingest-worker is alive but NOT ready — it cannot reach Kafka`
  while this deployment's own `/readyz` answered 200 with Kafka reachable,
  alongside four services reported healthy that the probe never touched. A
  diagnostic that names the wrong deployment is worse than a vague one,
  because it sends the operator to debug something that is not theirs. The
  probes now default to the port this project actually published, falling
  back to the canonical one when compose cannot answer — so a single-stack
  install is unchanged — and an explicit `AISOC_*_URL` still wins over both.
  `web`, `realtime` and `agents` had no override at all and were purely
  hardcoded; they also read the *host* port where `docker compose port` is
  keyed on the container port, which differs for two of the three.

- **The onboarding hero's screencast card was a dead link wearing a stale
  promise.** It pointed at `/demo.mp4`, a text placeholder, labelled
  "Coming v8.0" — three majors after v8.0 shipped — and described a
  four-case product tour nobody had recorded. It now links the walkthrough
  below, is thumbnailed with a real frame from it rather than a hand-drawn
  SVG that could drift from the content, and describes what the recording
  actually contains. The four-case tour is still unrecorded and its brief
  stays in `apps/web/public/.demo-mp4-placeholder`, now saying so plainly.

### Added

- **A recorded deployment walkthrough, and the written form of it.**
  `apps/web/public/demo/demo.mp4` (2 min 57 s) takes one host from nothing to
  an AI triage verdict: `make up` against the images published on GHCR, the
  console signed into at a LAN address rather than `localhost`, the CISA
  Known Exploited Vulnerabilities feed already populated with no API key, one
  event pushed through the documented ingest path, `make smoke` reporting ten
  stages, and the resulting alert with its measured token counts. README
  embeds `hero.gif`, a 17-second loop cut from the same file — an animated
  image renders inline on GitHub, on mirrors and on package pages, where a
  `<video>` pointing at a repository path does not.

  Everything in it is real: real images, real feed, real alert, real tokens.
  Demo mode was off and nothing was seeded. The event was authored to be
  representative and the recording says so. Terminal waits are shortened,
  disclosed by a badge on screen for the whole of every segment it applies
  to; the browser sections run at real speed. Both triage runs in the
  recording fell back to the deterministic path because the bundled
  3B model's output failed schema validation, and the closing card states
  that rather than hiding it — the token counts are real because the model
  really was called; what failed was the shape of its reply.

  `apps/docs/docs/deployment/walkthrough.md` is the same path in prose, with
  the detail three minutes has no room for: why `AISOC_CONSOLE_BIND_ADDR` and
  `AISOC_CONSOLE_URL` are separate decisions, that the CISA feed's primary URL
  answers `403` to non-browser clients and the service falls back to a mirror
  (a warning line followed by `CISA KEV IOCs ingested` is the healthy path),
  and how to run a second stack beside an existing one — every service pins a
  `container_name`, so a distinct project name alone is not enough, and
  `make up`'s port pre-flight reads `docker compose port`, which cannot see a
  remap on a host where no container has started yet.

- `scripts/check_published_images.py` — the gate none of the above had. It
  resolves every image reference in `docker-compose.yml` and the Helm chart
  the way the tooling that reads them does (`${AISOC_VERSION:-latest}` to its
  default, an empty chart `tag:` to `Chart.AppVersion`) and asks GHCR whether
  each one is there, optionally checking that the version inside matches the
  tree. Against `main` before this change it reported 14 findings across both
  files. Third-party images are counted and named but not resolved: this
  checks the images *this project publishes*, and upstream availability is not
  a claim this repository makes. Offline it prints `SKIPPED` and never `OK`,
  because a skip is not a pass; `--require-network` makes unreachable a
  failure, which is what the scheduled job uses. `--self-test` covers 28
  assertions including every shape the registry was actually in.

- `.github/workflows/image-availability.yml` — runs that gate daily against
  `main`, and `publish-images.yml` and `release.yml` each run it over their own
  output, so a half-published release fails the run that half-published it.

- `apps/docs/docs/deployment/single-host.md` — the path for a server you reach
  over the network: publishing the console, pointing it at your services,
  confirming what the deployment thinks it is, and what changes on the way to
  Kubernetes.
- `tests/test_console_runtime_config_gate.py` — runs the real resolver against
  the real `next.config.js` and asserts an operator's chosen API address is
  the one the console proxies to, plus the deployment contract that carries
  it. All five fail against `v11.0.0`.

## [11.0.0] — 2026-09-25

### BREAKING

- **`POST /v1/ingest` and `POST /v1/ingest/batch` now require a credential,
  and the tenant comes from the credential rather than from the
  `X-Tenant-ID` header.** The endpoint the README tells users to push
  telemetry to, and the one `make smoke` exercises, authenticated nothing:
  it read `X-Tenant-ID`, believed it, and wrote events for whatever tenant
  the caller named. Anyone who could reach the port could write alerts into
  any tenant by typing that tenant's UUID. Compose binds the port to
  `127.0.0.1`, which contains it locally, but ingesting real telemetry means
  exposing it and nothing said so at the moment the operator did. The
  comment at `services/ingest/internal/server/server.go` asserting that
  "`/v1/ingest` is token-authenticated per request" had been false since it
  was written; it is true now.

  Rather than invent a second mechanism this extends the one the service
  already had. `/v1/inbox/*` resolves a minted token from
  `tenant_inbox_tokens` to a tenant, with optional HMAC-SHA256 over
  `X-Signature`; `/v1/ingest` now resolves the same kind of token, pinned to
  a new `connector-push` template exactly as `/v1/inbox/cef` is pinned to
  `cef-syslog` — an inbox token is pasted into a third party's webhook
  config, so minting one for PagerDuty must not also hand PagerDuty a
  general ingest credential. A second shape covers AiSOC's own services:
  `services/connectors` polls on behalf of many tenants and cannot hold a
  per-tenant token, so it presents `AISOC_SERVICE_TOKEN` and declares the
  tenant on `X-Tenant-ID`, which is then checked against the tenants table
  before it becomes a scope.

  `X-Tenant-ID` is still read and is never authority. It is **intersected**
  with what the credential authorises, so naming an outside tenant narrows
  to nothing and is refused rather than reaching out — the same
  intersection-only rule `app/security/tenant_scope.py` already implements
  for the Python services, ported to Go in
  `services/ingest/internal/ingestauth`. There is no dev-mode bypass:
  `AISOC_DEV_MODE` does not reach this path, and an ingest service that
  cannot verify a credential answers 503 rather than accepting the write.

  **Every deployment must act.** Mint a push token per external pusher with
  `make ingest-token`, and set `AISOC_SERVICE_TOKEN` on both `ingest` and
  `connectors` if you use pull connectors — without it, connector polling is
  refused, loudly, at startup on one side and per request on the other. Full
  procedure: `apps/docs/docs/operations/ingest-authentication.md`.

- **CORE now needs 8 GB of memory and 20 GB of free disk, up from `~6.5 GB`.**
  A machine that ran the previous CORE profile may not start this one, and the
  failure arrives as containers being killed rather than as a message naming
  the requirement — so this is a prerequisite change to read before upgrading,
  not a footnote. The cause is that CORE stopped being a profile with nothing
  to show: `threatintel` and `qdrant` moved in so a fresh `make up` holds real
  CISA KEV data with no credentials, and `ollama` moved in with its pinned
  `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` so triage runs against a real model with real
  token counts. Measured before and after on the same machine: 11 long-running
  services become 14 plus a one-shot model pull, unique image layers 8.11 GB →
  16.46 GB, model weights a new 2.02 GB volume, and resident memory for the
  whole stack 1.72 GiB → 4.84 GiB. Ollama is 9.6 MiB resident when idle and
  2.96 GiB while serving a request; the requirement is sized against the
  second. The full table is under **Fixed → Measured, not estimated**.

### The landing page now shows the product, and points at the repository

- **The only place the marketing site claimed to show the console was an
  invented one.** `DemoEmbed` drew a hand-authored Investigation Ledger: an
  incident id, a named ransomware family, `confidence 0.93`, `$0.084` spent
  against a named hosted model, "4 hosts · 2 users", "step 14 of 32". None of
  it was labelled as a mock and none of it had ever happened. It is replaced
  by `ProductTour`, four captures of a running CORE stack taken from
  `apps/web/public/screenshots/`: the local model's triage verdict, 1,725
  live CISA KEV entries, the degraded graph view naming its own `API 503`,
  and an operations dashboard on a tenant with nothing connected. Two of the
  four are deliberately empty or degraded states. The section lede carries
  the distinction the manifest records — the security events were authored
  and pushed through the documented ingest API; normalization, detection,
  promotion, correlation and triage were performed by the running services,
  no row was seeded, and none of it is a real intrusion.

- **The fold had no picture of the product and its primary button pointed at
  the maintainers' hosted host.** The hero is rebuilt left-aligned around a
  real capture of the dashboard — chosen because its mean-time-to-resolve
  reads *not measured · no cases closed* — with the repository as the primary
  call to action and the two commands that reproduce the screenshot below it.
  The same substitution lands in the site-wide nav and the closing band, so
  the destination on every marketing page is now the source. Four entries
  were **dropped** from `scripts/check_hosted_hostname.py` rather than
  renumbered, because the occurrences are gone rather than reduced.

- **`Testimonials` was an empty state that asserted a programme.** It
  headlined "What teams say after their first month" over an offer to onboard
  reference partners "through Q2 2026" — a window that had closed. Replaced
  by `HonestLimits`, which states six limitations against the artefacts that
  measure them, including the one the page most wanted to skip: the bundled
  3B model returned schema-valid triage output **7 times in a measured run of
  19**, and the other 12 fell back to the deterministic path.

- **Four landing-page claims were stale or unsupported against the tree.**
  The FAQ answered "what runs in production today?" with beta deployments
  through reference partners, which nothing supports; quoted a `cryptography`
  floor three majors behind what the services declare; described the
  retracted alert-reduction suite as "a real measurement"; and named managed
  data-residency regions. The benchmark band published *Sub-minute p50* as a
  metric when `mtc_p50_seconds` is null on every scoreboard row — it now
  reads **not measured**, with the reason. The open-source band told visitors
  to run `pnpm aisoc:demo`, which loads the synthetic dataset, so the three
  commands a reader was given produced the one thing this project asks them
  not to mistake for the product working; it is `make up && make smoke`. The
  footer had shipped `v7.3.1` hard-coded through seven major releases and now
  reads the version the release flow bumps. The visible FAQ and the
  `FAQPage` JSON-LD were corrected together, and the structured data's
  hand-typed "69 ship in the box" now reads the generated connector count.

- **Capabilities the site had never mentioned** are on it: verified response
  (the executor probes the vendor rather than trusting an HTTP 200),
  authenticated ingest with the tenant resolved from the credential,
  row-level security on 83 tables behind a DML-only runtime role, two-way
  SIEM writeback of agent dispositions, and the cost and token telemetry in
  the ledger.

### Discoverability: the machine-readable surface, and an installer that wrote a config nothing could start

A project an AI agent cannot read accurately is a project it will describe
inaccurately, and the one-command install that was supposed to be the easy
path did not work at all.

- **`aisoc-mcp install` wrote `npx -y @aisoc/mcp serve` unconditionally, from
  every source build.** `@aisoc/mcp` is not on npm — the release workflow packs
  it on every tag and the upload is blocked on registry credentials — so the
  installer's output was a config file that parsed, wrote cleanly, reported
  success, and could never launch. The host surfaced "server failed to start"
  with no reason, at the point the user had already decided to adopt it. The
  existing test asserted the broken behaviour verbatim ("always uses `npx -y`
  so users don't need a global install"), so a full suite proved it.

  `install` now resolves a launcher: from a monorepo build it writes
  `node <absolute path to dist/index.js> serve`, from an installed package it
  writes the `npx` form, and `--launcher node|npx|auto` forces either. Forcing
  `npx` today prints why it will not start. Verified end to end by launching
  the generated config and completing an MCP handshake against it.

- **`install --verbose` wrote `AISOC_VERBOSE` while the server reads
  `AISOC_MCP_VERBOSE`,** so the one setting whose entire purpose is diagnosing
  a misbehaving server was dead in every installed config. Its test asserted
  the producer's own spelling rather than checking the consumer reads it; the
  replacement runs the written environment back through `resolveConfig`.

- **`llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt`** now publish at the documentation root, the
  convention LLM-backed tools fetch instead of scraping a rendered navigation
  tree. Both are **generated** by `scripts/generate_llms_txt.py` from the
  artefacts that already own each figure — the connector registry and the
  detection truth table — because a summary written *for* machine readers is
  the worst place for a hand-typed count to rot, and this repository has
  published 47 connectors against a real 84 before. `--check` is a CI gate and
  the generator carries a self-test proving it refuses an empty tree.

- **The documentation site's Open Graph card was undecodable.**
  `img/aisoc-social-card.png` held 277 bytes of SVG, so every crawler was
  served `image/png` with SVG bytes and rendered no image at all; `favicon.ico`
  had the same defect. Both are now real PNGs rendered from committed SVG
  sources by `apps/web/scripts/render-og-images.mjs`.

- **The marketing Open Graph card named the commercial parent.** It read
  "Built by Cyble" and "Free forever" beneath a stale "v3 milestone" pill —
  on the open-source project's card, which a self-hoster shares when linking
  their own deployment. Rewritten without any of the three, and the metadata
  now points at a PNG: Slack, LinkedIn, Facebook and X all decline to render
  an SVG `og:image`, so the previous `og-image.svg` produced no card anywhere.
  The landing page's OG description also sent readers to a commercial hostname;
  removed.

- **schema.org `SoftwareApplication` and `WebSite` markup** on the docs site,
  carrying only independently checkable assertions — MIT licence, genuinely
  zero price, canonical repository. No `aggregateRating` or `review`, because
  no such data exists. The marketing site's existing markup hard-coded
  "26 security sources" and now reads the generated `CONNECTOR_COUNT`.

- **`services/mcp/server.json`**, an MCP registry manifest validated against
  the published `2025-12-11` schema. It deliberately declares **no `packages`
  entry** — optional in the schema — so a directory listing sends a reader to
  the source rather than to an install command that would 404.
  `tests/registry.test.ts` asserts the manifest and the README's
  "ready, unpublished" line can only change together.

- The MCP README and `docs/integrations/mcp.md` promised npm publication "in
  v8.0" three major versions after v8.0 shipped, claimed 50 tests against a
  real 124, and asserted an audit trail that `services/mcp/src/telemetry.ts`
  already documents as untrue — `audit_middleware` records no row for any of
  the ten read tools. Corrected, along with the competitor-framed "moat" line.


### `make up` reported the stack broken on every machine, and four published numbers were wrong

Found by bringing the stack up from the documented path and photographing the
result. Each of these was visible within minutes of a real first run and
invisible to the test suite.

- **`make up` could not succeed, ever.** Its `_wait` loop scored any container
  in state `exited` as broken, and `ollama-pull` is a one-shot: it fetches the
  model, exits 0, and `litellm` waits on `service_completed_successfully`, so
  by the time `docker compose up -d` returns the puller has *always* exited.
  The documented command therefore ended in `These services are not running:
  ollama-pull` against a completely healthy stack — the step whose job is to
  say whether the stack is healthy, reporting the opposite. Fixed by reading
  `{{.ExitCode}}` and treating `exited 0` as a one-shot that did its job.
  The first attempt at that fix did not work either, for a reason worth
  recording: a service with no healthcheck prints an *empty* `Health`, and
  awk's default whitespace splitting collapses the run, so `ollama-pull
  exited  0` parsed as three fields with the exit code in `$3` — the new test
  read an empty `$4` on exactly the row it was written for. The fields are
  `|`-separated now.

- **Four of the ten shipped ingest profiles rendered their vendor twice.**
  `product_label()` deduplicated the vendor/product join on exact equality, so
  `crowdstrike` + `crowdstrike` collapsed but `Okta` + `Okta System Log` did
  not. The alert queue, the Investigation Rail and every entity chip read
  "Okta Okta System Log", "Splunk Splunk Enterprise", "Kubernetes Kubernetes
  Audit" and "Email Forwarded Email". A part another part already contains is
  dropped now, on word boundaries so "AWS" is not swallowed by a product
  called "Lawsuit Monitor", and the new test reads the pairs *out of the Go
  normalizer* rather than restating them — the previous tests passed every
  hand-written case while four shipped profiles were wrong, because none of
  them asked the normalizer what it actually declares.

- **The Threat Intelligence page published its own page length as the size of
  the catalogue.** With 1,725 CISA KEV entries collected, Qdrant held 1,725,
  the API answered `total: 400` (the size of its bounded scan window) and the
  console's headline card read **100** (its page). Three answers to one
  question, the two published ones both wrong, and the page presenting the
  smallest as the corpus. `total` is now the store's own count, `shown` is the
  page, and a narrowed query is marked `bounded` so a caller knows the match
  was made inside a window.

- **`Added Today` on that same page was the literal `3`, hard-coded**, on
  every deployment including ones that had never ingested an indicator. The
  comment four lines above it describes removing an invented IOC list for
  exactly this reason and names this counter while doing so; the counter
  survived. Replaced with figures the page can support — the store's count,
  the page's count, and two counts explicitly labelled *of shown*. The
  sample-data gate did not catch it and could not: it scans module-scope
  fabricated-record literals, and this was a scalar inside JSX.

- **Nothing in the console rendered the AI verdict.** `services/agents`
  triages every fused alert and writes `ai_score`, `ai_summary`,
  `triage_groundedness` and `triage_ungrounded` back onto the row; the API
  returns all four; `normalizeAlert` dropped all four on the floor. The
  product's headline capability was producing tokens, cost and a ledger entry
  that no surface showed. The Investigation Rail's Details view now carries an
  **Automated triage** section rendering the verdict, the confidence, the
  rationale *verbatim* — so a reader can tell the model's own text from the
  deterministic fallback — and groundedness as **not assessed** when the
  column is null, never as 0.

### Real screenshots, and an architecture doc that follows one event

- **Every committed screenshot is now a capture of a running stack.** The
  24 MB `screenshots/` tree was a marketing redesign from an older product and
  no longer resembled it; the four tiles under
  `apps/web/public/screenshots/` were SVG placeholders. Both are replaced by
  16 PNGs (844 KB total) taken from a CORE stack brought up with `make up`,
  fed through the documented ingest API, holding 1,725 real CISA KEV entries
  and a real local-model verdict. `apps/web/public/screenshots/README.md`
  states what is real in each one and what was authored — the security events
  were written by hand; everything downstream of them is the product working.
  **None was taken in demo mode.**

- **`apps/docs/docs/architecture.md` is organised around what happens when
  AiSOC receives one security event** — eleven numbered steps from the two
  ingest doors through normalization, the spine, detection, enrichment,
  promotion, correlation, alerting, AI triage, the ledger, approval and
  verified response — instead of the component inventory it was. Every box in
  every diagram links to the directory that implements it, and all 31 source
  links were checked to resolve. It also records what the previous version got
  wrong: ports (the page listed host ports as though services addressed each
  other on them), `50 vendors` against 84, `200+` detection rules against 833
  executable, and five packages still promised "in v8.0" two releases later.

- **Measured figures, re-read rather than carried forward.** CORE is 14
  long-running services plus a one-shot model pull; `full` is 22. The playbook
  palette offers **21** of the engine's 22 step types — `approval` is withheld
  because the engine is a single-threaded index walk with no pause or resume.
  Row-level security is live on 83 tables under 84 policies, and the runtime
  role holds `SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE` and no DDL.

- **The local model's triage output is now described honestly.** In a measured
  run of 19 auto-triages on a CORE stack the bundled
  `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` returned schema-valid JSON 7 times; the other
  12 fell back to the deterministic path and logged that they had. The README
  and the architecture page both publish that ratio rather than implying the
  model answers every time. No hosted provider has been exercised — there is
  still no funded key, and that remains a different claim.

### Added

- **`RENDER_FALLBACK_EXEMPT` is now checked in both directions.**
  `ALLOWED_ILLUSTRATIVE` had a staleness check from the start and this list
  had none, so an exemption could outlive the code it excused and go on
  covering whatever was written next under that name.
- **A corpus floor.** The gate refuses a root holding no `.ts`/`.tsx` rather
  than certifying it: a renamed directory or a changed suffix produces zero
  findings over zero files, and found-nothing and scanned-nothing print the
  same word. It also names what it scanned, rooted at `git rev-parse`.
- **A real `--self-test`.** Twenty-six cases, each asserting the *rule* that
  must account for it rather than that something fired — the conditional rules
  overlap by construction, so a boolean check would pass with half the fixes
  reverted. Each case builds its own source and its own tree.
- **`KNOWN_UNGATED`**, a shrink-only ledger of sites the detector reports and
  the tree has not fixed, each with a reason, so a stricter rule can land
  without weakening it. Not an exemption: while an entry stands the gate
  prints the outstanding count instead of the unqualified "all gated"
  sentence. Recorded by count, so an entry cannot survive its own fix and a
  second violation cannot hide behind a recorded one. It shipped holding the
  seven sites this revision first detected and is **empty** — they were fixed
  in a parallel change, the counts stopped matching, and the entries had to be
  deleted before the build would pass. The console is now genuinely clean:
  21 module-scope fabricated-record literals, 21 of them gated.

- **`scripts/generate_corpus_stats.py`** — generates
  `apps/web/src/data/corpus-stats.json` + `corpusStats.ts` from the compiled
  engine ruleset, the generated detection truth table, and the marketplace
  index, reconciling all three against each other and refusing to publish if
  they disagree. Every landing surface imports the constants, so none can
  carry its own literal. `--check` is wired into `ci.yml :: python-lint`;
  `--self-test` hand-edits the artefact and requires the drift to be caught.
  The artefact keeps `executable` and `onDisk`/`quarantined` as separate
  fields, and the UI leads with the executable count.
- **`scripts/check_alert_reduction_claims.py`** — prose cannot be generated
  the way a count can, so the retraction is gated instead. No published
  surface may assert the legacy harness runs the production grouping; any
  surface quoting 75.3 % must carry the retraction; the `alert_reduction`
  suite card may not be declared `kind: 'measurement'`; and every surface
  publishing the real figure must quote `PUBLISHED_REDUCTION_PCT`, a new
  constant in `services/fusion/tests/test_alert_reduction_real.py` that the
  test asserts against its own measurement — so the chain from measurement
  to published prose has no hand-copied link. A paragraph that dates or
  negates the claim is exempt, so the retraction can quote the wording it
  retracts.
- **The prerequisites that were required but undocumented.** Beyond Docker and
  its memory, a first run needs `python3` **on the host** (`make smoke` runs
  the golden-pipeline script there, so without it you can start AiSOC but
  cannot prove it works), `bash` (`make up` gates on `scripts/doctor.sh
  --ports-only` before it calls compose), and roughly 18 GB of free Docker
  disk — previously implied only by a troubleshooting row noting that Kafka
  corrupts its log directory and *still passes its healthcheck* when the
  daemon runs out of space. Node 22 and pnpm 8, which the installers require,
  were also unlisted. All are now in the quick-start prerequisites table with
  the command each one gates.
- **`scripts/check_demo_state_gated.py`** — a CI gate that asks the two
  questions which do not depend on guessing the next syntax. *Is the
  fabricated value reachable?* — every read of a fabricated symbol must have a
  gate in scope, so `cond ? x : MOCK` fails and so does whatever replaces it.
  *Does the component decide for itself that it is a demo?* — no component may
  hold demo/sample **mode** in local state, because state derived from a fetch
  failure fabricates exactly when the backend is unhealthy.
  It treats three things as fabricated: a `MOCK_*`/`DEMO_*`-style constant; a
  factory that builds one (the constant convention could not see
  `buildDemoCase`); and any constant assembled out of either (`EASMView`
  declared `const SUMMARY = { totalAssets: MOCK_ASSETS.length, … }`, carrying
  the fabrication under a name the convention does not cover). It accepts the
  four ways this tree legitimately gates — the read's own bracket-balanced
  statement, an enclosing `if`, an early return, and a local derived from the
  gate — but **not** a bare mention of the gate elsewhere in the file, which
  is the hole `SLADashboard` fell through. Its `KNOWN_UNGATED` ratchet is
  empty and checked in both directions; a gate seeded with its own exceptions
  has never been true.

- **The playbook parity gate now reads every declaration of the step
  vocabulary, wherever it is.** `scripts/check_playbook_schema_parity.py`
  compared the engine against `packages/types/src/playbook.ts` and never
  opened `apps/web`; naming the editor's file here would have fixed that file
  and left the next one free. The TypeScript half is a scan: every `.ts` and
  `.tsx` file in the tree is parsed for literal collections of step-type
  names, and any collection overlapping the engine's vocabulary must either
  match it exactly or be a recorded subset with a reason, checked in both
  directions so an exemption that stops being needed fails the build. The
  editor's execution annotations are compared against the schema's
  `x-aisoc-execution` in both directions as well, so a surface cannot tell an
  author a step will run when the contract says it will not. `--list` prints
  what the scan credited, not only what it flagged, and the gate refuses to
  report agreement when it finds no declaration at all.

  Against `origin/main` it reports 56 disagreements across all five
  vocabularies; against this tree it credits five declarations, each complete.

  Two limits are stated rather than left implicit: a collection overlapping
  the vocabulary by fewer than two members is not treated as one, and a list
  derived at runtime is not a literal and is not seen — which is the shape the
  gate wants, because a derived list cannot drift. A file the reader cannot
  parse to the end is never silently skipped: it is checked for step-type
  names in its raw bytes first, and the gate refuses the tree if it finds any.

- **A WCAG AA sweep over all twenty-two inspector forms.** The labels in
  `SchemaForm` and `StepInspector` sat beside their controls with no
  association, requiredness was an `aria-hidden` asterisk, help text was
  unreferenced, and the error summary named fields it could not be reached
  from. Controls now carry ids, labels `htmlFor`, `aria-required`,
  `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby`; errors are reported per field as well
  as in the summary; the condition and params groups are fieldsets. The sweep
  also caught `<ul role="alert">`, which is not an allowed role for a list and
  left its items without a list parent.

### Changed

- **`readme_gates.py` covers the governance documents.** Its `FIGURE_DOCS`
  list named one compliance page, which is why `ROADMAP.md` drifted with CI
  green. `ROADMAP.md` and `RELEASES.md` are now on the list, the matrix
  **row total** is compared as well as the GATED/PARTIAL split, and a figure
  the prose explicitly dates ("the count at that time") is exempt so history
  need not be rewritten.
- **`check_scoreboard.py --check` verifies `agent_version` against
  `VERSION`.** `--refresh` already stamped it; nothing compared it, and the
  freshness gate reads only the date — which a refresh keeps current — so a
  row could be two days old and still labelled two majors behind.
### Fixed

- **`/customers/example` published a fabricated case study on the public
  site.** `generateStaticParams` pre-rendered every file in
  `apps/web/content/customers/`, and `getCustomerBySlug` never consulted the
  `draft` flag, so the template shipped as scaffolding was built into the
  static output and served: a company that does not exist, invented
  before/after numbers, a quote attributed to a role at it, and a claim that a
  SOC 2 Type II auditor closed three named controls. The index page was
  correct — it filters drafts — which is what made this invisible: the
  fabrication was reachable only by its own URL, and by search engines.

  Drafts are now excluded from pre-rendering, and resolve by slug only outside
  production so an author can still preview their own work. Verified against
  the build output rather than the source: the study appears in no file under
  `.next/`, only the index route is generated, and the sitemap lists
  `/customers` alone.

  The index itself asserted customers exist when none do. Its metadata read
  "Reference customers running AiSOC in production", its Open Graph
  description promised "the before/after metrics each team reports", and its
  heading read "Teams running AiSOC in production." — all published while the
  published-study count was zero. The page now says so plainly and points at
  the real screenshots and the repository instead.

- **A duplicate "Investigation Chat" entry in the console sidebar.** It pointed
  at `/investigate`, which permanently redirects to `/hunt` — a route the
  sidebar already lists — so the entry advertised a surface that was collapsed
  into Hunt, and whose component was removed as fabricated. Clicking it landed
  on Hunt with the highlight on a different item than the one clicked.


- **The `Public papers (regenerate PDFs)` workflow could never succeed on
  `main`, and its design hid that from everyone opening a PR.** Its final step
  pushed refreshed PDFs directly to `main`, which stopped being possible when
  `main` became branch-protected — the push is rejected with
  `GH006: Protected branch update failed`. Because that step is skipped on pull
  requests, the workflow passed on every branch and failed only on `main`, so
  contributors saw green while `main` carried a permanently red workflow.
  Redirecting it to open a pull request instead is not available either: this
  repository has Actions set to read-only permissions with pull-request
  creation disabled.

  It now reports staleness rather than repairing it, and `make papers` plus a
  commit is the documented refresh path. The check compares each markdown
  source's SHA-256 against the digest recorded when its PDF was last rendered
  (`apps/web/public/papers/render-manifest.json`, written by `make papers`).
  It deliberately does **not** compare PDF bytes — the workflow's own comment
  asserted the render was deterministic, and it is not: WeasyPrint stamps a
  creation timestamp into its output and glyph metrics depend on the host's
  installed fonts, so two correct renders of one source differ and a byte
  comparison would fail for reasons unrelated to staleness. Each of the five
  conditions it claims to catch — edited source, missing PDF, unrecorded
  render, orphaned manifest entry, and no sources at all — is now asserted by
  a `--self-test` that runs as its own CI step ahead of the gate, so a check
  that has stopped detecting anything cannot report the tree clean. Each rule
  was then removed in turn to confirm the self-test fails without it. The run
  also fails if any source renders no PDF, which nothing previously checked.

  Adding a verdict mode made this script a gate, which `check_gate_contract.py`
  then judged by the same contract as the other 85: it reported that the script
  derived its repository root from `__file__` rather than asking git, and that
  it declared no self-test. Both are fixed. The control case in that self-test
  earned its place immediately — a nested helper assigned to the module paths
  without a `global` declaration, so all five cases silently graded the real
  tree, and only the case that *expects* a pass revealed it.

  Two things fell out of the change. `apps/web/public/papers/README.md` told
  readers "you no longer have to run the renderer locally before opening a PR"
  and described the commit-back step as current behaviour; both were false and
  are corrected. And the removed step set a commercial email domain as the
  commit author inside the open-source repository, so its `check_hosted_hostname.py`
  allow-list entry went with it — caught by that gate's own staleness check,
  which reported an exemption recording two occurrences in a file that now has
  none.

- **`check_mock_data_gated.py` reported "All sample-data fallbacks are gated
  behind demo mode." on a tree carrying nine of them.** Each gap was confirmed
  by running the gate's own patterns against the live lines rather than by
  reading them, and every fix is falsifiable on its own: reverting any one of
  them turns exactly one self-test case red.

  The dominant one was the fabrication test. It required an identity **and**
  at least two numeric keys, so four datasets with zero numbers between them
  were invisible — including fifteen invented ATT&CK coverage verdicts from
  which `CoverageAdvisorView.tsx` derives and prints a coverage percentage.
  The harm was never numeric, and the headline figure never existed as a
  literal the gate could match. The numeric requirement is gone, replaced by
  two unequal arms: an **estate identifier** — a hostname, an address, a
  ticket reference — stands alone, because no filter list or route table in
  this console contains one; a **proper noun** counts only alongside an
  assertion of state, because most of this console's configuration is made of
  proper nouns. That distinction is what separates fifteen coverage verdicts
  from the fourteen-entry MITRE tactic vocabulary two directories away.

  Eight more: a ternary (`cond ? real : MOCK_X`) is the same bypass as `??`
  and matched nothing; a demo factory reached by `return` rather than through
  a setter; an inline object literal handed to a setter in a `catch`, which
  the docstring had always claimed to catch and never did; `= {` object
  literals, scanned now like `= [` arrays; `useState(MOCK_X)`; a one-record
  array, under a `< 3` floor; a single `(` defeating `\s*` in the nullish
  rule; and `.ts` modules, which the record glob never opened.

  Gating is now decided **per constant** from its use sites, not once per
  file: one `demoFallback` anywhere used to credit every dataset in the
  module, and `HuntView.tsx` has exactly that pair. `_is_exempt_name` was a
  substring test over the whole line, so a line mentioning an editor
  placeholder was skipped even when it also carried a real bypass.

  Two things the relaxed detector got wrong, both found by enumerating what it
  *credits* rather than what it flags: a comment explaining why a mock is
  **not** reached at render was counted as a use of it, so three components
  were reported for documenting their own fix; and the marketing pages'
  published disclosure address matched the mailbox arm, so a mailbox now
  counts as estate data only when it is not sitting beside the link you are
  meant to click.

- **A retracted benchmark figure was still badged "Real measurement".**
  `apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md` withdrew the 75.3 % alert-reduction claim —
  the harness that produced it groups on four tiers of `(rule_id, host,
  user)` while the shipping `RawAlert.correlation_key()` groups on
  `{tenant}:{entity}:{tactic}`, so it does not merely re-implement fusion's
  grouping, it implements *different* grouping. The retraction reached one
  surface of five. `BenchmarkResults.tsx` rendered a green **"Real
  measurement"** badge on `0.753` with a blurb claiming the harness used the
  production rules, "same logic"; `benchmarks/alert-reduction.md`
  (`sidebar_position: 1`) called it a "faithful in-harness re-implementation"
  and headlined 75.3 %; `ComparisonTable.tsx` qualified it as "measured on
  fixed noisy stream". Two more were found while gating the invariant:
  `benchmark-methodology.md`, and `benchmark.md` itself, which re-asserted
  the claim in its own intro blockquote. All five now carry the wording
  `benchmark.md` already uses. The comparison table quotes **33.3 %**, the
  figure measured against the key the product actually runs.
- **The landing page published three different wrong corpus counts.**
  "6,998 detections" in four places (the tree indexes 7,016, of which 5,937
  are quarantined and the engine loads **833**), "57 plugins" (77), "7,117
  community items" (7,155), and `218 rules across 5 categories` on the
  contributor leaderboard (833 across 6). The 6,998 figure also quoted the
  imported corpus as the detection capability, presenting quarantined rules
  as executable.
- **Governance figures had gone stale.** `ROADMAP.md` published "136 rows —
  128 GATED / 8 PARTIAL" against a matrix holding 139 / 131, in the same
  sentence that tells the reader to recount with the script "rather than
  trusting a figure quoted in prose — this line has gone stale before".
  `CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md` carried a stale executable-rule figure (939) in
  a row note. The scoreboard's newest substrate row was labelled `v8.1.1`
  while `VERSION` read `10.0.0`; it is refreshed from a fresh deterministic
  run (0.97, unchanged) and now carries the tree's version. The scoreboard
  keeps its three rows, all `substrate: true`, and no live-LLM row was
  invented.
- **The "Design partners" block on the landing page was removed** rather
  than updated. Four dashed "Partner A–D" chips under the caption
  "Reference partners onboarding through Q2 2026": placeholders rather than
  fabricated logos, but four of them assert a partner count nothing in the
  repository supports, and the window closed in June 2026 while still being
  advertised as upcoming.
- **The Windows installer routed evaluators to a stack that cannot answer the
  question they came to ask.** `install.sh` was changed to bring up the real
  deployment, create an administrator and verify the pipeline; `install.ps1`
  was not, and nothing noticed. It handed off to `pnpm aisoc:demo` — a compose
  file that opens by saying it does not run the AiSOC pipeline, has no ingest
  service and no fusion service, sets `AISOC_DISABLE_KAFKA=true`, and whose
  console content comes entirely from a seed script writing rows straight into
  Postgres — and then printed `AiSOC is up and running.` A Windows user saw a
  populated console and concluded the platform worked, having never run the
  platform. `install.ps1` now performs the stages `make up` and `make smoke`
  perform: a port pre-check that names the process holding a port rather than
  letting compose fail with `Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed`, `docker compose
  up -d`, a wait that reads `docker compose ps -a` so an exited or
  crash-looping container fails rather than passing, `docker compose run --rm
  -T api python -m app.scripts.bootstrap_admin`, and the golden-pipeline
  runner. Windows has no `make` and the Makefile's recipes are POSIX shell, so
  these are native re-implementations of the same commands rather than a
  `make` call; `tests/test_installer_parity_gate.py` fails the build if the
  two installers diverge again.
- **No administrator was created on Windows, and the closing banner said
  nothing about credentials.** A Windows user either could not sign in at all
  or signed in to a seeded database and evaluated that as the product. The
  banner now surfaces the generated password the same way `install.sh` does:
  printed once, stored nowhere, with the reset command alongside it. It also
  no longer claims the pipeline was verified when the check was skipped for
  want of a Python interpreter.
- **`install.ps1` pointed at an uninstaller that does not exist.** The closing
  banner named `.\scripts\install\uninstall.ps1`; the file is `uninstall.ps1`
  at the repository root and has never been anywhere else, so the last
  instruction the installer gave a Windows user could not work. The parity
  gate now asserts every `.ps1` path either script tells a user to run is a
  file in the repository.
- **`uninstall.ps1` left the whole stack running while reporting success.** It
  tore down only `infra/compose/docker-compose.demo.yml`, so every CORE
  container — Postgres still holding 5432 — survived an uninstall that said it
  was complete. It now brings down the root `docker-compose.yml` project
  across every optional profile, then the demo project for anyone who ran the
  older installer.
- **`install.ps1` installed dependencies nobody tested.** It used
  `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` where `install.sh` uses
  `--frozen-lockfile` for the stated reason that a self-hoster's install must
  not quietly resolve a dependency set CI never saw. It also accepted Node 20
  where `install.sh` requires 22, the version every workflow tests on and both
  Node images ship. Both now match, and the gate compares them.
- **The docs portal contradicted the README on whether the pipeline works.**
  `quickstart.md` was a pre-v8.2 page built around `pnpm aisoc:demo`; because
  the scripts it named still exist, nothing errored and it simply took readers
  to the wrong stack. Three statements were false. It claimed `.env.example`
  ships "a pre-generated dev `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`" — it ships a placeholder
  that is worse than an empty value, because an empty one makes the API
  generate an ephemeral key and warn while a malformed one makes the
  credential vault raise, so the first request touching a connector secret
  returns HTTP 500. It claimed events posted to `/v1/ingest/batch` "accept
  cleanly but never become `Alert` rows", which is the exact path `make smoke`
  asserts and the README publishes as its headline proof. And its cheat sheet
  offered `aisoc keygen` as the way to generate that vault key, when `aisoc
  keygen` writes an Ed25519 plugin-signing pair to `~/.aisoc/signing.key` and
  has nothing to do with Fernet. The page is now written around `make up`,
  `make bootstrap` and `make smoke`, and its compose-profile table was rebuilt
  from `docker-compose.yml` rather than corrected from the old text — six port
  numbers and profile memberships were wrong, and two whole profiles were
  missing.
- **`installation.md` documented flags that do not exist.** `-SkipDemo`,
  `AISOC_SKIP_DEMO` and `-AisocDir` are not accepted by either installer; the
  real spellings are `--no-launch` / `-NoLaunch` and `--clone-dir` /
  `-CloneDir`. The page also still promised a browser opening on a seeded
  ransomware case with pre-filled credentials, which no longer happens and for
  which there are no default credentials.
- **Five banners that misdiagnosed their own failure.** Four of them claimed
  to be showing data they were not showing, which is worse than no banner: the
  operator now has a confident diagnosis, it is wrong, and they spend the next
  hour on the service it named. `ConnectorsView` printed "Connectors API
  unreachable — showing demo instances so you can explore the interface" above
  a list that is `data?.connectors ?? []` and therefore empty outside the
  hosted demo, with four stat tiles reading a confident `0` beside it.
  `RBACView` printed "showing demo roles" while `roles` was `undefined`, which
  suppressed both the skeleton and the empty state — the banner was the only
  thing on the page. `PlaybooksView` printed "showing demo playbooks", and a
  truthy `error` suppressed its empty state too. `EffectivePermissionsView`
  said "falling back to demo data" when `demoFallback(DEMO_RESULT)` is
  `undefined` and there is no fallback, over a blank Cytoscape canvas with no
  explanation at all. And the copilot pill labelled **any** error "Demo mode"
  on deployments that are not the demo, beside a green "Connected" that
  asserted connectivity before a single request had been made.
  `lib/failure.ts` generalises the fix already made for the entity-risk queue.
  Two rules: **name the upstream service only when that service is genuinely
  at fault** (a 422 is a malformed request from the console and the backend is
  healthy and saying so; a 401 is an expired session; neither is an outage),
  and **say the data is unknown, never empty** — an empty list and an
  unreadable list look identical and mean opposite things. `FailureBanner`
  carries a retry that re-issues the request, which none of the five had; the
  copilot surfaces a failed question in the thread with a retry that re-sends
  it rather than leaving it unanswered under a pill. Two fetchers that threw
  `new Error('HTTP 404')` and `new Error('Failed to fetch')` now throw
  `ApiError`, because a status discarded in prose is a status no banner can
  reason about. Every test asserts on **first paint** as well as the error
  branch: `data` is `undefined` in both states, so a suite that only drives
  the error branch never exercises the one a self-hoster sees on every load.
- **Three surfaces that asked for the wrong tenant's data.** `/purple-team`
  had `const TENANT_ID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'` at module
  scope and used it for all nine of its requests, so on any deployment with
  more than one tenant it read another tenant's ATT&CK coverage, drift
  history, executions and tabletop sessions — and *wrote* into that tenant,
  since "Capture snapshot" and "Create session" used the same literal.
  `/honeytokens` had the same literal behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID`, which is
  inlined at build time and is therefore one constant for every operator of
  every tenant. Both now read the active tenant from `TenantProvider`, and
  every request is `null`-gated on it so nothing is issued against a guess.
- **`/fim` was not tenant-scoped, and its own comment had gone stale.** The
  component pinned `TENANT_ID = 'default'` and explained that
  `services/osquery-tls` used a different tenancy model. That service had in
  fact already been reconciled: its read path resolves a tenant UUID from the
  caller's credential and lists `'default'` as a *placeholder* meaning "the
  caller did not name a tenant", precisely because migration `001` seeds that
  slug and the demo seed renames it to `demo`. What was actually broken: the
  console sent no credential at all, so there was no scope to resolve; and
  `/fim/summary` resolved the scope correctly for its total and then filtered
  its by-action and top-paths breakdowns on the **raw** query parameter, so
  one card showed three numbers computed against two different tenants. Not a
  leak — anything out of scope was already refused — but wrong. The client
  sends the session bearer and no tenant; the endpoint filters every query on
  the resolved scope. Still unreconciled and now stated rather than implied:
  node *enrolment* keys `Node.tenant_id` as a `String(64)` defaulting to
  `"default"`, so a node enrolled with no tenant header writes events under a
  string no console read can resolve. That is an enrolment-side migration.
  Three contract breaks found while proving the tenancy fix was observable,
  all of which made the page unusable regardless of tenancy: the summary
  response never carried `active_nodes` while the card called
  `.toLocaleString()` on it; the events response is `{items, offset, limit}`
  and the client read `{events, page, page_size}`; and the client sent
  `page`/`page_size`/`since` to an endpoint declaring `offset`/`limit` and no
  `since`, so FastAPI dropped all three — every page showed the same first 100
  rows and every time window showed the same events.
- **A non-promoted event now leaves a thread to pull.**
  `promote_normalized_event` returned `None` and the consumer incremented
  `not_promoted`. The aggregate reached `/metrics`, so an operator could see
  that events were being dropped and nothing else — not which connector, not
  what shape, not why. "I connected my SIEM and no alerts appeared" is the
  first question a new user asks and a counter cannot answer it. The log now
  names the connector, the OCSF class and category, the severity, which
  promotion condition was not met, and that the event is in the lake.
  **Volume:** this is the hot path and most ingested telemetry is correctly
  not promoted, so a line per event would be the platform's highest-volume log
  and would cost more than the pipeline it describes. A pure time-sampled
  rollup is wrong the other way — somebody who has just connected a source
  needs the answer in seconds. So both, split by novelty: the **first** event
  of each distinct `(connector, class, severity, reason)` shape is explained
  in full immediately, everything after it is counted into a rollup emitted at
  most once per 60s (`AISOC_NOT_PROMOTED_ROLLUP_SECONDS`). Steady-state cost
  is one line per minute regardless of throughput. Tracked shapes are capped
  so a connector emitting a garbage `class_uid` per event cannot make the
  sampler a memory leak.
- **`splunk_enterprise` stays non-promoting, and now says so on the event.**
  The profile maps raw Splunk *search result rows* (`_time`, `src`, `dst`,
  `user`), not notables, and it stays at `classUID: 4001`: promoting each row
  of an arbitrary saved search would turn a result set into an alert queue,
  which is what the `splunk` profile at 2001 already does properly for
  findings that have passed Splunk's own correlation. Its `severityMap` was
  literally empty, which was read as the cause of the silence; it was not —
  severity mapping already falls through to the shared five-tier ladder, so a
  row carrying `severity: "critical"` scores 5 and promotes. Naming that
  ladder on the profile changes nothing at runtime and stops the next reader
  making the same diagnosis. What remains true is that a row with **no**
  severity field scores 0, and category 4 with severity 0 satisfies neither
  branch — such an event now carries a `normalization_warnings` entry saying
  exactly that, which lands in the lake beside it rather than scrolling past
  in a log. A test pins the two constants against the fusion policy they
  mirror.
- **Organisation memory reaches the triage prompt.** `active_statements`
  compiles repeated, tagged analyst disagreement into durable statements; a
  repo-wide grep returned exactly one match, its own definition. Its write
  counterpart `record_disagreement` had no caller either, so the memory was
  neither written nor read and the platform triaged the next identical alert
  knowing nothing about the last one being overturned. Both ends are wired,
  because wiring only the read would have been a query against a table nothing
  populates: `POST /feedback/alert-override` takes an optional `reason_code`
  from the closed vocabulary, and the agents triage worker reads
  `GET /feedback/context-statements` into the prompt over HTTP — the API owns
  the session and the expiry semantics, and a second copy of that SQL would be
  a second definition of "active". Statements are presented to the model as
  advisory evidence rather than instructions, because a statement needs two
  analysts and phrasing it as fact hands anyone who can produce two benign
  votes a suppression the model obeys. Fails soft, caches for 120s, and
  `test_organisation_memory_in_prompt.py` proves the claim by capturing the
  messages handed to the model with and without a recorded disagreement and
  diffing them.
- `EmptyState` accepts a `headingLevel`. `ConnectorsView` renders it directly
  under the page `h1`, so the default `h3` skipped a level and failed
  axe-core's `heading-order` rule.
- **Six console surfaces rendered fabricated security data outside demo mode,
  on a tree where the existing gate reported clean.** The gate recognises
  *shapes* — a bare mock in SWR's `fallbackData`, a mock through a state
  setter, a mock behind `??`. Each was added after a specific escape, so each
  knows only the syntax that got past it last time.
  `SLADashboard.tsx` wrote the same defect as a ternary. Line 446 passed
  `fallbackData: demoFallback(MOCK_SLA_METRICS)`, which is correct and which
  the gate accepted; line 457 then read `isValidMetrics ? rawMetrics :
  MOCK_SLA_METRICS`. Outside the hosted demo `demoFallback` returns
  `undefined`, so the test is falsy on **first paint as much as on error**,
  and 847 alerts, 23 breaches, a 2.7% breach rate and a 42.5-minute MTTR
  rendered in both states, identically, on every deployment. The disclosure
  banner fired only on `metricsError`, so during loading the invented figures
  appeared with nothing saying so.
  The worst of the six was `CaseWorkspace.tsx`. A failed case load rendered
  `buildDemoCase(caseId)`, which copies the route param, so the invention did
  not present as sample data — it presented *as the case the analyst had
  opened*, with an invented title, assignee, four linked alert ids, three
  ATT&CK techniques and a five-event timeline including "Auto-investigation
  completed". Separately, a failed `casesApi.investigate` was caught and
  turned into `status: 'completed'` carrying recon IOCs (`192.168.1.105`,
  `c2.evil-corp.io`), a forensic root cause at 0.88 confidence drawn as a
  progress bar, three containment actions and a four-entry agent audit log.
  The structured panels carried no caveat of their own; only a transient
  toast did, and it is gone by the time anyone reads the verdict. This is the
  `AlertDetailView` catch-block defect from v10.0.0, surviving in a second
  file. And `updateStatus` mutated the SWR cache optimistically and, on
  failure, toasted "writes disabled" without rolling back, so the workspace
  showed a status the database did not have.
  `HuntView.tsx` had no demo gate at all: its `demoMode` was a local
  `useState(false)` flipped by **fetch failure**, so it substituted three
  detections on named hosts with encoded-PowerShell command lines precisely
  when the backend was unhealthy — when a reader is least equipped to notice.
  It also published `took: 42`, a query latency for a query that never ran,
  in the same line as a real measurement.
  `CoverageAdvisorView.tsx` was fabricated end to end, with no API call
  anywhere in the file: fifteen invented ATT&CK verdicts whose recommendation
  column asserted deployment state it could not know ("Existing PowerShell &
  Bash rules active"), four headline cards computed from them so "Coverage
  50%" and "Critical Gaps 5" were byte-identical everywhere, and one button
  that raised `toast.success('Detection rule draft created')` and created
  nothing. It now reads `GET /api/v1/detection/coverage`.
- **`/coverage-advisor` reports what that endpoint can actually support.**
  The endpoint returns one cell per technique *at least one rule references*,
  so a technique nobody has written a rule for never appears and a percentage
  over those cells is not coverage of ATT&CK — on a tenant with three rules it
  would read 100%. The page therefore reports the fraction, names its own
  blind spot in the body copy, and publishes no coverage score. "Covered"
  means *enabled*: a technique whose only rules are switched off gets its own
  status and a link to those rules, because a disabled rule detects exactly as
  much as no rule. The `ROADMAP.md` and `apps/docs/docs/architecture.md`
  claims that it "ranks technique gaps by adversary prevalence" were corrected
  — no prevalence data exists anywhere in the tree.
- **The server fetch on `/cases` was discarded on every non-demo
  deployment.** `initialCases` is documented as server-rendered data that
  avoids a flash of mock content. It was folded into the same object as
  `MOCK_CASES` and the whole thing passed through `demoFallback(fallback)`,
  which returns `undefined` outside the hosted demo *regardless of whether
  real SSR data was supplied* — so the round-trip in `cases/page.tsx` was
  made, awaited and thrown away. Real SSR data is not sample data, and the
  gate that withholds one must not withhold the other.
- **`CopilotDock` answered a failed request with an assistant turn.** Same
  class as the above: a local `demoMode` flipped by fetch failure. Outside the
  hosted demo the dock now reports that the copilot could not be reached, with
  the error, instead of emitting a reply.

**The documented quick start broke the product, and then the product had
nothing to show.** Every item below passed the existing test suite and
failed on a real deployment. They are grouped by what a new user actually
hit, in the order they hit it.

#### Following the README broke the credential vault

- **`.env.example` shipped `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY=replace-me-with-a-freshly-generated-fernet-key`,
  and `cp .env.example .env` is step two of the quick start.** The vault takes
  its friendly ephemeral-development-key path only when the key is *empty*; a
  non-empty invalid key reaches `Fernet()` and raises, which the connector
  endpoints turn into HTTP 500 `credential vault unavailable`. Nothing failed
  at boot. So **not** copying the template produced a working vault and
  following the documented instructions produced a broken one, discovered
  minutes later at the connector wizard with nothing linking the two.

  Fixed at setup rather than in the vault: `make up` now runs
  `scripts/ensure_env.py`, which creates `.env` and writes a real random value
  for `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY` and `AISOC_SERVICE_TOKEN`. It is
  idempotent and never rotates a value an operator already set, and it uses
  the standard library so it does not put a `pip install` in front of
  `make up`. Teaching the vault to tolerate a placeholder was the alternative
  and would have been worse: a deployment whose saved connector credentials
  silently do not survive a restart. The three secrets now ship **empty** in
  the template as well, so a hand-copied `.env` degrades to the documented
  development path instead of a hard 500.

- **`make doctor`'s placeholder check matched neither placeholder the
  repository shipped.** It grepped
  `^[A-Z_]*(SECRET|PASSWORD|KEY)=(change_me|changeme|)$` while the template
  carried `replace-me-…` and `change-this-…` — a gate built to catch shipped
  placeholders that was blind to every shipped placeholder, and that reported
  clean on the one `.env` that broke the vault. The check now delegates to
  `scripts/check_env_placeholders.py`, and `tests/test_env_placeholder_gate.py`
  compares the detector against the template in both directions: every
  non-empty value in `.env.example` must be either recognised as a placeholder
  or declared in the test as a deliberate working default. A new placeholder
  cannot be added without one of the two failing.

#### The connector wizard could not complete

Three independent causes, all silent, all fixed:

- **The API was never given the credential it presents to the connectors
  service.** `_service_token()` reads `AISOC_CONNECTORS_SERVICE_TOKEN` then
  `AISOC_SERVICE_TOKEN`; compose interpolated the shared token into
  `connectors`, `ueba`, `honeytokens` and `purple-team` and **not into the one
  service that has to send it**, and with no `env_file` anywhere a value in
  `.env` could not reach it by any route. Every catalog call was answered 401
  and fell back to the bundled copy with `degraded=True`. Measured after the
  fix: the catalog is `live` with **84** connectors instead of the bundled 26.

- **"Test connection" sent no `Authorization` header at all.** The catalog call
  beside it had been given one and this one had not, so it was answered 401 on
  every invocation — and 401 was the one status the ladder did not branch on,
  so it fell through and returned a body with no `success` key. The wizard
  reads `result.success`, found it absent, and rendered the bare string
  **"Connection test failed"** for an internal service-auth misconfiguration,
  while its own help text promised "Credentials are tested against the
  upstream API". The upstream API was never reached. It now sends the same
  headers as the catalog call, branches on 401/403 explicitly, refuses any
  unhandled 4xx rather than returning it as a verdict, and guarantees a
  `success` key. An operator now sees: *"connectors service returned HTTP 401
  to this API's service credential. AiSOC's API could not authenticate to its
  own connectors service, so your credentials were never sent upstream. Set
  `AISOC_SERVICE_TOKEN` …"*. The wizard also reads FastAPI's `detail` out of
  the response body instead of showing only the status line.

- **The connectors service answered 503 to everything on a default stack.**
  Its `SECRET_KEY` compose default is one of `INSECURE_SECRET_DEFAULTS`, so
  `resolve_console_secret()` returns `""`; with `AISOC_SERVICE_TOKEN` also
  blank it has no credential material and fails closed, correctly. The
  dev-mode escape that exists for exactly that case was set on `actions`,
  `ueba`, `honeytokens`, `purple-team` and `slack-bot`, and not on
  `connectors`. Now set — and once `make env` generates a real token, dev mode
  stops applying at all.

#### CORE had no real data and no AI

- **`services/threatintel` and `qdrant` moved from the `full` profile into
  CORE.** The CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog is authoritative,
  public and needs no API key, and has been wired as a scheduled handler the
  whole time in a profile nobody starting out runs. Meanwhile the console
  shipped a `/threat-intel` page whose endpoint existed in no profile, and that
  page was recently caught rendering five invented IOCs. The missing feed and
  the fabrication were one hole. A fresh `make up` now populates the console
  with **1,723 real KEV entries** within a minute of boot, with no credentials.
  New: `GET /api/v1/threat-intel/indicators` on the API, proxying a new
  indicators route on `services/threatintel` backed by Qdrant.

- **A daily feed would not have polled for a day.** `FeedScheduler.register`
  handed APScheduler an `IntervalTrigger` and nothing else, and an interval
  trigger schedules its *first* run one whole interval after start — 86400
  seconds for KEV. A fresh install had a healthy container, a registered feed,
  a created collection, and an empty page for twenty-four hours, with nothing
  anywhere reporting a fault. First poll is now jittered into the first twenty
  seconds.

- **CISA's edge returns 403 to whole networks regardless of user agent.**
  Observed with curl, httpx and a browser UA. Without a fallback every
  deployment on such a network gets permanently zero indicators and no error a
  user would see. The canonical `cisa.gov` URL stays primary; CISA's own
  `cisagov/kev-data` GitHub repository — same publisher, identical schema — is
  the fallback, and the log line names which source answered.

- **OpenSearch and Neo4j are no longer required by `threatintel`.** Its
  lifespan called `os_store.initialize()` with no `try`, which made a
  `full`-profile store a hard dependency of a CORE service. Both that call and
  the pipeline's bulk index are best-effort now: with OpenSearch you
  additionally get full-text IOC search; without it the feeds still write to
  Qdrant, which is what the console reads.

- **Ollama moved from the air-gapped overlay into CORE**, with its pinned
  `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` (~2 GB, CPU-only). The gateway had already
  moved into CORE and the models it pointed at had not, so a default install
  could route a key nobody had. `make up` now produces real triage verdicts
  from a real model with real token counts. `litellm` waits on the model pull
  completing rather than on Ollama being healthy, because a gateway that is up
  before the weights exist answers the first request — the one a new user
  makes — with "model not found". The aliases in `infra/litellm/config.yaml`
  now read their backend from the environment, so moving to a hosted provider
  is three variables in `.env` rather than an edit to a mounted config file.

- **Every auto-triage run on a default install was dead-lettered.**
  `record_auto_triage` bound the two cost columns directly while
  `complete_run` beside it used `COALESCE`; both are `NOT NULL`, and
  `estimated_cost_usd` is `None` for every run against a local model because
  there is no list price for `ollama_chat/…`. The UPDATE violated the
  constraint, the transaction rolled back, the worker retried three times and
  dead-lettered the alert — a real LLM call, real tokens, and no verdict in
  the console. Found only because a model shipped in CORE made it the normal
  case rather than an edge case.

- **A small model that stops mid-JSON no longer loses its verdict.** Measured
  against the bundled model, triage responses arrive with the closing quote
  and brace absent and `finish_reason: "stop"` — every field the caller reads
  present and correct, and the whole response discarded. The parser now closes
  what the model opened, and nothing more: a fragment too damaged to read
  still raises, so the deterministic fallback stays reachable rather than a
  verdict being invented from an empty object. A failed parse now logs a
  bounded excerpt of what the model actually said, which previously could only
  be discovered by reproducing the prompt by hand.

#### Other first-run friction

- **`ENVIRONMENT` was a bare literal in `docker-compose.yml`**, so the value
  `.env.example` documents was ignored and setting `production` changed
  nothing — including the dev auth bypass in `dev_auth.py`, which could not be
  switched off from `.env` at all. Now interpolated, along with `LOG_LEVEL`.
- **`AISOC_CONSOLE_URL` appeared in no `.env.example` entry, no compose
  service and no doc**, so every deployment that is not a laptop printed the
  wrong sign-in address beside a password shown exactly once. Now wired and
  documented.
- **`python3`, `bash` and the Docker disk requirement were undocumented** while
  `make smoke` — the README's headline proof — runs a Python script on the
  host. `make doctor` now checks for both interpreters, and the measured
  requirements are published.
- **`handler.go` rendered its over-size error with `string(rune(…))`**, so a
  limit of 1000 told the caller their batch exceeded a maximum of `Ϩ`.
- **`apps/docs/docs/operations/security.md` named an init script that does not
  exist** (`zz_runtime_role_password.sh`; the file is
  `20_runtime_role_password.sh`).

#### Measured, not estimated

CORE's published figures moved because the footprint was measured before and
after on the same machine:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Services | 11 | 14 (plus a one-shot model pull) |
| Images, unique layers | 8.11 GB | 16.46 GB |
| Model weights (named volume) | — | 2.02 GB |
| Resident memory, whole stack | 1.72 GiB | 4.84 GiB |

The README's `~6.5 GB` becomes **8 GB of memory and 20 GB of disk**. Ollama is
9.6 MiB resident when idle and 2.96 GiB while serving a request; the second
number is the one the requirement is sized against.

### Removed

- **`apps/web/src/components/copilot/InvestigationChat.tsx`** — canned
  threat-intel replies ("VirusTotal: 14/87 engines flagged malicious",
  "Associated campaigns: APT-42"), a fixed context sidebar, no API call for
  the chat, and imported by no file. One import from being live, which is the
  `MitreStrip.tsx` precedent exactly. It also embedded a personal email
  address in OSS source; the same string in `FunnelKpiBar.tsx` was removed
  too. `/investigate` already permanently redirects to `/hunt`, and the
  multi-turn copilot is `CopilotDock` and `/copilot`, so the docs line naming
  this component was corrected rather than the component wired.

- **The playbook editor could author nine of the engine's twenty-two step
  types, and the build was green.** `apps/web/src/components/playbooks/types.ts`
  declared its own nine-member `StepType` union under a header comment
  claiming it mirrored `services/agents/app/playbook/models.py`, which
  declares twenty-two. The registry behind every form is keyed
  `Record<StepType, StepSchema>`, so exhaustiveness was satisfied against the
  *local* union and thirteen missing forms compiled cleanly; had it imported
  the union from `packages/types`, `Record` would have failed with thirteen
  missing keys. None of the fourteen files in the directory imported the
  published package. It now re-exports `StepType` from `@aisoc/types`, and the
  compiler named the gap.

  The thirteen forms are built: `block_ioc`, `osquery_live_query`,
  `disable_user`, `reset_password`, `revoke_session`, `force_mfa`,
  `kill_process`, `quarantine_file`, `run_av_scan`, `run_script`,
  `search_siem`, `create_notable_event`, and `approval`. Each collects what
  its executor in `services/actions` reads, and each governed verb's target
  field is keyed on the name `engine._resolve_target` actually looks for, so a
  saved step carries its own target rather than depending on the alert context
  happening to hold one. Nothing collects a credential — those are resolved
  per tenant from the connector vault at dispatch — and nothing offers a
  `dry_run` control, because the bridge does not read one.

  `approval` is presented, never offered. The engine records it in
  `_UNBRIDGEABLE` with a full reason, so the palette and the type dropdown
  filter on `execution !== 'unimplemented'` rather than on its name, an
  existing `approval` step still renders so an imported playbook can be read
  and fixed, and the inspector states that the engine fails the step closed
  and the run stops there.

- **`osquery_live_query` reported SUCCESS while running nothing.** Its handler
  returned an error dict when the osquery backend clients could not be
  imported — which is always, in the shipped agents image, because those
  clients live in `services/actions` — and a returned dict leaves the step
  status at SUCCESS. Reachable from the console the moment the editor could
  author the type, so it now raises `PermanentStepFailure` and fails closed.

- **Three more partial vocabularies in the same directory.** `stepColors.ts`
  held a second nine-entry `Record<StepType, …>`; `StepInspector` and
  `PlaybookEditor` each hard-coded a nine-member array. All three are derived
  from the registry now. `packHelpers.ts` mapped step types to integration
  badges as a `Record<string, …>` covering eighteen of twenty-two, so a
  playbook built from the other four claimed to use no integrations at all.
## [10.0.0] — 2026-09-25

**Two ways for a control to be absent: not written, or written and not
reachable.** This release is mostly the second. Row-level security covered 92
tables and filtered nothing, because every service connected to Postgres as a
superuser. Fifty-eight routes across four services carried no authentication
at all. UEBA consumed events, reported healthy, and could not write a baseline
or an anomaly. AI triage was wired to a gateway that both of its resolvers had
been deliberately written to ignore. In each case the mechanism was present
and the path to it was not.

Read the BREAKING section before upgrading. **Every deployment must act on one
item**: services now connect as a DML-only `aisoc_app` role rather than as the
schema owner, which is what makes those 92 policies filter. The bundled
Postgres provisions it on a fresh volume; an existing volume or a managed
database does not.

Two published figures moved because they were measured rather than restated:
CORE is **11 services** — the LLM gateway is in it now, so a provider key
works with no profile change — and `full` is **21**, not the 30 previously
published. The quick start also ends differently: `make up` creates an
administrator and prints a generated password once, because the credential
pair the documentation used to publish was wrong in three independent ways and
nobody following the README could sign in.

### BREAKING

- **The services no longer connect to Postgres as a superuser, so the 92
  row-level-security policies added below now actually filter.** The previous
  entry closed the coverage gap and measured, in the same breath, that none of
  it did anything: `docker-compose.yml`, the CI service containers, the Helm
  chart and the Terraform environment all ran every service as
  `POSTGRES_USER=aisoc`, which the postgres image creates as a **superuser**,
  and a superuser ignores policies *even under* `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` —
  FORCE binds the table owner, not a superuser. Sixty-one new policies bought
  nothing operationally.

  `061_runtime_app_role.sql` splits the credential in two. `aisoc` owns the
  schema and applies migrations; `aisoc_app` is what every service connects
  as, holding `USAGE` on `public`, `SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE` on
  tables and views, `USAGE, SELECT` on sequences and `EXECUTE` on functions —
  no `CREATE`, no `TRUNCATE` (`002_rls.sql` had granted `ALL`, which let one
  statement delete every tenant's rows without a policy seeing a `WHERE`
  clause), and ownership of nothing. Measured on `postgres:16` with two alerts
  seeded one per tenant and the session bound to tenant A, reading `alerts`
  with **no tenant predicate at all**: the old role saw 2, the new role sees
  1, and an insert for tenant B is refused by the policy.

  Things this turned up along the way, each of which would have survived the
  role switch and quietly undone it:

  - **Two views read around every policy underneath them.** A view executes as
    its *owner* unless declared `security_invoker`, and both views here are
    owned by the role that ran the chain. Bound to tenant A,
    `mssp_tenant_latest_metrics` returned 2 rows before and 1 after.
  - **`SET LOCAL row_security = off` stops being a no-op and becomes a
    crash.** For a role the policies apply to, Postgres refuses the query
    rather than ignoring the policy. The retention purge, the hunt scheduler's
    sweep and tenant deletion all used it; all three now rely on the
    `OR current_tenant_id() IS NULL` arm and call `assert_cross_tenant_session()`
    first, which raises if a tenant *is* bound — a sweep that sees one tenant
    and reports success is worse than one that fails.
  - **`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` still needs `CREATE` on the schema when the
    table already exists**, because Postgres checks the ACL before the
    existence test. Two stores in `services/agents` opened their pool that way
    and swallowed the failure into `logger.debug`, so the agents service would
    have silently recorded no cost telemetry and no institutional memory at
    all. Both tables are already in the migration chain; the bootstrap now
    probes first and reports at `error` if it genuinely has to create one.

  Deployment surfaces updated: `docker-compose.yml`, the demo compose stack,
  `integration.yml`, the Helm chart's `values.yaml`, the Terraform environment
  (which now generates the runtime role's password rather than reusing the RDS
  master user) and `.env.example`. `infra/postgres/initdb/zz_runtime_role_password.sh`
  sets the credential on a fresh volume before the container reports healthy;
  `app.scripts.run_migrations` applies it on every run, which covers an
  upgrade in place. **Operators on a managed Postgres must act**: apply the
  chain as the owner with `AISOC_APP_DB_PASSWORD` set, then point
  `DATABASE_URL` at `aisoc_app` and `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` at the owner.
  `002_rls.sql` created `aisoc_app` with the literal password `changeme`; 061
  does not clear it (that would break an operator who had already set a real
  one), so rotate it if none of the automatic paths applies to you.

  Two new gates, both with a self-test that runs before the scan and both
  failing over an empty or absent tree. `scripts/check_runtime_db_role.py`
  fails if a runtime DSN connects as the role that surface provisions as the
  database superuser — structurally, by reading `POSTGRES_USER` /
  `db_username` out of the tree rather than matching a name — and in
  `--dsn` mode reads `pg_roles` and `pg_class` directly, catching
  `rolsuper`, `rolbypassrls`, ownership, a view without `security_invoker`,
  and a role still accepting `changeme`. `scripts/check_rls_policy_shape.py`
  fails if a policy is written without the fail-open arm, replaying the chain
  in order so a definition a later migration repaired is not reported. Both
  run in `isolation.yml`; the live half runs in `integration.yml`.

  `tests/isolation/test_postgres_rls.py` now reads as `DATABASE_URL` — the
  role the deployment ships — instead of a `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` role it
  constructed for itself, so its 80-table two-tenant replay covers what ships.
  `test_superuser_bypasses_rls_which_is_why_the_probe_role_exists` is replaced
  by its inverse.

- **The four services that run their own alembic chain now migrate as the
  owner and serve as the runtime role, and three of them were not reached by
  the role switch at all.** `honeytokens`, `osquery-tls`, `purple-team` and
  `ueba` manage their own schema, and each applied it as whatever DSN the
  operator supplied — so their migration and runtime credentials were the same
  one, and pointing such a service at the owner turned off row-level security
  for the twelve tables those chains own with nothing objecting. Each
  `env.py` now reads `<SERVICE>_DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`, then
  `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`, and only then falls back to the runtime DSN with a
  warning on stderr naming what will break.

  Three things were found while wiring it, each measured rather than inferred:

  - **`DATABASE_URL` was inert on three of the four.** `docker-compose.yml`
    sets it on every service, but `honeytokens`, `purple-team` and
    `osquery-tls` declare `env_prefix` in their settings, so the name they
    read is `HONEYTOKEN_DATABASE_URL` and the compose entry did nothing: each
    fell back to a default naming the **owner**. Both spellings now resolve,
    unprefixed first, the convention `services/ueba` and `services/fusion`
    already used. Operator note: on a deployment that sets both to *different*
    databases, the unprefixed one now wins.
  - **The four chains shared one `alembic_version` table** — they share one
    database in the default deployment and number their revisions identically.
    Following `apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md` against `postgres:16`: after
    `ueba` reached `0002`, `honeytokens alembic upgrade head` ran **zero**
    migrations and `purple-team` failed applying its RLS revision to tables
    that had never been created, so two services had no tables and no policies
    and every command reported success. Each chain now keeps its own version
    table and adopts an existing deployment's recorded version on the next
    upgrade — only when that chain's own tables are already present, so it
    cannot claim a sibling's row.
  - **The runtime role had no grant on those tables.**
    `061_runtime_app_role.sql` grants over `ALL TABLES` as they stood and sets
    `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` for the role that issued it; nothing orders the
    chains against it, and a deployment applying them under different owners
    gets neither. Each chain now grants `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE` on its
    own tables, guarded so it is a notice rather than a failure where the role
    does not exist.

  Verified live on `postgres:16` with all four chains applied and two tenants
  seeded: bound to one tenant the runtime role sees one row of two in
  `ueba_entity_baselines`, `honeytokens` and `osquery_node`; unbound it sees
  both, which is the fail-open arm the cross-tenant sweeps depend on; a
  cross-tenant insert is refused by the policy; `CREATE TABLE` is refused with
  `permission denied for schema public`; `ALTER TABLE … NO FORCE ROW LEVEL
  SECURITY` with `must be owner of table`; and `SET LOCAL row_security = off`
  raises rather than doing nothing. None of the four chains creates a view, so
  the `security_invoker` hazard does not arise there, and none of the four
  services issues DDL outside its chain.

- **The published `aisoc-web:latest` image shipped demo mode baked on**, and
  it is the image `docker-compose.yml` pulls for `make up`. Next inlines
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` at build time, so there was no runtime escape: a
  self-hoster's console announced "Demo data resets daily at 00:00 UTC. All
  write actions are disabled." over their own real alerts, disabled every
  write control, and offered a "Self-host AiSOC" link inside an already
  self-hosted install. The only remedy was to rebuild the image.

  The demo is now its own build under its own tag. `latest`, `main` and
  `vX.Y.Z` are the product with demo mode off; `demo` and `vX.Y.Z-demo` carry
  the demo bundle, and `infra/compose/docker-compose.demo.yml` pulls those.
  Nothing has to choose between a working demo and a usable self-host image.

  Demo credentials are also no longer compiled into a non-demo bundle at all.
  `apps/web/Dockerfile` defaulted the autologin address and password to real
  values, and `login/page.tsx` and `DemoAutoLogin.tsx` each declared them as
  module-level literals — gating the *render* on `isDemoMode()` hid the panel
  but left the strings in every chunk the project ships. All three now read
  them from the build environment, and only the demo build supplies them.

- **Three MSSP response schemas describing fabricated data are removed:
  `MSSPKpiOverview`, `ManagedTenantRow`, `CrossTenantIncident`.** They were
  the shape of five hardcoded companies with invented alert counts, not the
  shape of anything the platform measured. `/mssp/overview`,
  `/mssp/tenants` and `/mssp/incidents` keep their paths and now return
  `PortfolioSummaryOut`, `PortfolioTenantOut` and `PortfolioAlertOut`,
  computed from real rows.

  What moved, and why it could not be preserved:

  - `health_score` / `avg_health_score` are **gone**, not nulled. It was an
    undefined composite with no formula anywhere in the tree; keeping the
    field would promise a measurement that does not exist. (`MetricsOut` on
    the separate `/mssp/metrics` route still carries a `health_score` and is
    unchanged by this release.)
  - `avg_mttr_minutes` → `mttr_minutes`, measured from cases a tenant
    actually closed in the trailing 30 days, and **null** when it closed
    none. The old value was the literal `23.4`. Present on both the per-tenant
    row and the portfolio summary, where it averages only over tenants that
    closed something rather than counting a null as a zero.
  - `sla_breach_count` and `sla_breaches` → `sla_breached_cases`, counted
    from `cases.sla_breached`.
  - `connectors_online` / `connectors_degraded` / `connector_status` →
    `total` / `healthy` / `stale` / `error`, derived from each connector's
    `health_status` and `last_sync`. Nested under a `connectors` object on
    the per-tenant row; flat `connectors_*` fields on the summary.
  - `tenant_id` is now a real tenant UUID rather than a string like
    `"t-acme"`.
  - `assignee` is gone from the incident rows. It named invented analysts;
    an alert's real owner is `case_id`, which is now returned instead.
  - New: `synthetic_alerts`, so seeded demo rows are counted apart from a
    tenant's real posture instead of inflating it.

  The routes also return `403` to a caller who belongs to no operator
  organisation, where they previously returned an empty list to anyone
  authenticated.

  Nothing in `apps/web` consumes these three routes; it calls
  `/mssp/children`, which is unchanged.

- **Two `ActionType` members are removed: `add_ioc_to_blocklist` and
  `run_playbook`.** Neither had an executor. `POST /actions` accepted both and
  answered `No executor found for action type`, which reads as a broken
  deployment rather than a verb nobody built; it now rejects them at
  validation. A verb with no implementation path should leave the surface
  rather than sit on it dead.

  Why neither could be preserved by implementing it:

  - `add_ioc_to_blocklist` was a second name for `block_ioc`, which has a
    Defender arm, a capability contract, a registered adapter and a place in
    the vocabulary. Two names for one verb means half the callers reach the
    dead one. Use `block_ioc`.
  - `run_playbook` is the wrong shape for this registry rather than a missing
    feature. Playbook execution lives in `services/agents` and always has, and
    the contract in this service belongs to the *verb* — "run an arbitrary
    bundle of verbs" has no verb-level impact, reversal or verification probe
    to declare. Approving it once would execute whatever steps it contained
    without each step meeting its own contract, which is precisely what the
    per-capability contract exists to prevent. Playbooks already dispatch step
    by step through this service, so every step is graded on the way past.

  The actions service's `ActionType` is not part of `docs/openapi.yaml`, so
  the breaking-change gate does not see this; it is recorded here because a
  dropped enum value is a break whether or not a workflow notices.

- **`CostTracker` no longer reports an estimated dollar figure as a measured
  one, and `CostTracker.total_cost_usd` is gone.** It priced a call by looking
  its **model name** up in a table of hosted list prices, and the name it
  looked up was an `aisoc-<role>` alias — a label the LiteLLM gateway resolves
  to a model, not a model. No alias is in the table, so every call fell
  through a `(0.001, 0.002)` default and was booked at a price nobody charges
  for a model nobody named. Measured live: a 903-token completion on an
  operator's own hardware, through a local Ollama model, reported
  `total_cost_usd=0.000999`. The same call now reports `$0.00`, measured.

  The figure was not confined to a dashboard. It fed the funnel insights, the
  per-run Investigation Ledger, the investigation summary export, and the
  **budget circuit breaker** — which trips at `AISOC_BUDGET_HARD_USD` and
  would eventually have degraded a working local install to
  deterministic-only over money nobody spent.

  Every cost is now one of three things, and says which:

  - **measured** — the gateway reported it. The real figure comes off the
    response headers (`x-litellm-response-cost`, and `x-litellm-model-name`
    for what the alias resolved to), so `make_chat_model` now builds clients
    with `include_response_headers=True`. A measured `0.0` — what a local
    model genuinely costs — is a value, not a gap.
  - **estimated** — re-priced from a public list price for a *concrete* model
    id, and labelled an estimate on every surface: `~$` in the console, an
    `estimated_cost_usd` field of its own on every response, and
    "list-price estimate … not billed" in the export. Never merged into a
    measured figure, because one number cannot be labelled two ways.
  - **not measured** — neither. Rendered as an em dash with the reason, never
    as `$0.00`. Following the MTTR precedent: the count of calls a sum was
    computed over travels with the sum, so a zero can be told from an absence.

  There is deliberately no default price any more. An unknown model imputes
  nothing and is counted as unpriced; the BYOK savings panel reports
  "not estimable" rather than a saving computed from an invented rate.

  **The wire is fully additive — no generated SDK client breaks.** The obvious
  shape for "not knowable" is a nullable number, and four fields were written
  that way first (`ByokSavings.imputed_public_cost_usd` / `savings_usd`,
  `ModelBreakdown.imputed_public_cost_usd`, `CostAggregateRow.avg_cost_per_run`).
  That is the wrong shape here for the same reason the MTTR pass rejected it:
  it breaks every client for a fact a companion field already carries. Each
  keeps its type and gains a qualifier — `imputed_is_estimable`, or the
  existing `measured_call_count` — and the console reads the qualifier before
  the number. `scripts/openapi_diff.py` reports no breaking change.

  What callers must change: `CostTracker.total_cost_usd` is replaced by
  `measured_cost_usd` (`float | None`) plus `measured_call_count`, mirrored by
  `estimated_cost_usd` / `estimated_call_count` / `unpriced_call_count`;
  `CallRecord.cost_usd` is now `float | None` and carries `cost_source`;
  `summary()` no longer emits a `total_cost_usd` key. On the wire the fields
  are additive — `total_cost_usd` keeps its name and now carries measured
  cost only, with `measured_call_count` beside it. Migration
  `063_cost_provenance.sql` adds the columns; **every pre-063 row reads as
  "not measured"**, which is the truth about it, and the historical values are
  left in place rather than deleted. Gated by
  `scripts/check_cost_provenance.py`.

### Added

- **Two-way SIEM integration: an AiSOC verdict is written back onto the
  finding that produced the alert.** The integration only ever ran inbound. A
  Splunk notable became an alert, the agent triaged it, and the notable sat in
  the Splunk queue untouched — so an analyst re-read a finding AiSOC had
  already dismissed, and a finding AiSOC had confirmed waited its turn behind
  them. Nothing on `main` wrote a disposition back to any SIEM in any form.

  New capability `update_alert_disposition` with five vendor arms (Splunk ES,
  Elastic Security, Microsoft Sentinel, IBM QRadar, Microsoft Defender), two
  new clients (`sentinel_client.py`, `qradar_client.py`), migration
  `057_alert_source_links.sql`, and `POST /api/v1/alerts/{id}/source-writeback`.
  The agents triage worker posts to that route after the verdict is durable and
  fails soft — the verdict outranks its writeback, and an unreachable Splunk
  must not dead-letter an alert that was triaged correctly. Docs:
  [Integrations → SIEM writeback](apps/docs/docs/integrations/siem-writeback.md).

  **The disposition mapping is the safety argument, not the approval tier.** A
  confirmed true positive is *escalated and never closed*: it is the finding a
  human most needs to see, and closing it because the platform is confident is
  how an agent turns a real intrusion into a resolved ticket nobody read. An
  unknown verdict is *refused, never guessed* — which matters because
  `normalize_disposition` defaults an unrecognised string to `true_positive`,
  so a mapper that normalised first would convert "I do not recognise this"
  into a confident claim. Only benign and false-positive verdicts may close a
  finding, and `benign_true_positive` is classified as a correct detection of
  authorised activity rather than as a false positive, so it never inflates a
  rule's own FP rate.

  **Governance ships dry-run by default.** `AISOC_SIEM_WRITEBACK_ENABLED`
  defaults on and `AISOC_SIEM_WRITEBACK_EXECUTE` defaults **off**, so an
  operator opts in to writing into their own SIEM. Anything that is not an
  explicit yes — including a typo — is read as a dry run. `executed` is the
  single field that means a vendor was touched; it is carried on the API
  response, on the worker's return value, and as a no-default column on
  `alert_source_links`, so a dry run, a refusal and a credential-less
  simulation can never be read as a write that happened. Projecting a closing
  verdict onto a linked Jira / ServiceNow ticket needs a third flag
  (`AISOC_SIEM_WRITEBACK_CLOSE_CASE`, off) because the ITSM connectors project
  a status transition rather than a note, so the only truthful way to reach the
  ticket is to resolve the case for real.

- **The join key survives ingest.** `finding.uid` — the vendor's own id for a
  finding — reached the OCSF envelope and was then discarded, so by the time a
  row hit `alerts` the notable's rule UID, the Elastic signal id and the QRadar
  offense id were gone and no verdict could be aimed at anything. Fusion now
  carries it onto `alerts.external_id` and writes an `alert_source_links` row,
  but only for a vendor with a writeback arm: a link to a system AiSOC cannot
  write to would read as a two-way integration that is not one.

- **`GET /api/v1/graph` exists.** The console's Attack Graph view has always
  called it and always got a 404, while `/graph/neighbors/…` and
  `/graph/mitre-coverage` returned 200 from the same Neo4j instance holding
  real graph-at-ingest data — the data and the scoping were sound and only
  the overview endpoint was missing.

  It returns the caller's own entity graph in the shape the Cytoscape canvas
  consumes, bounded to 400 nodes and 900 edges per render with `truncated`
  set when the cut was applied. `depth` (1–6) bounds the walk; `entity`
  narrows the seed set to one named host, user or indicator.

  Scoping follows the rule the other graph reads had to learn the hard way:
  **every node of every traversed path** must satisfy the tenant predicate,
  not only the node the walk starts from, and `tenant_id IS NULL` is never
  readable — an untagged node that were readable would bridge two tenants
  through any entity they share. Edges are returned only between nodes that
  first pass that filter, so an edge cannot reintroduce a node the node query
  refused. Global MITRE labels stay exempt, but cannot seed a traversal.

  Two failure modes are kept distinguishable. An empty graph is `200` with no
  nodes; an unreachable graph is `503`. It deliberately does not degrade to an
  empty graph the way `/graph/mitre-coverage` does, because "no attack
  relationships exist in your estate" is a security claim, and making it on
  evidence nobody retrieved is the shape of defect this codebase keeps
  rediscovering. The console's error state — which names the endpoint and the
  status rather than inventing topology — is unchanged, and a test now asserts
  the view holds no graph at **first paint**, so a future `fallbackData` (which
  disables revalidation, making a mock permanent rather than provisional)
  fails the build.

- **The Attack Graph says when it is showing a truncated graph.**
  `GET /api/v1/graph` bounds itself to 400 nodes and 900 edges and reports
  `truncated`; the console rendered the flag nowhere, so a graph cut at the
  ceiling and a graph that is genuinely that size looked identical. On an
  attack graph that difference changes a conclusion — a missing edge reads
  as a lateral path that does not exist. The view now shows a
  `role="status"` notice naming the counts, the depth and the ceiling that
  produced them, with a depth control that issues a new query rather than
  re-rendering the cached one. The three existing states are unchanged: an
  empty tenant still reads as empty, an unreachable backend still names the
  endpoint and the status, and neither is reported as a truncation.

- `GraphOverviewResponse` gains `nodeLimit` and `edgeLimit`, read from
  `graph_service` rather than restated, so the ceiling a client reports is
  the ceiling the service applied. Additive and defaulted; no existing
  consumer changes.

- **`/graph` honours `?entity=` and selects the node it names.** Three callers
  already built that URL — the Investigation Rail's entity chips, `HuntView`'s
  "Pivot to graph" button, and now federated search — and nothing read it, so
  every pivot navigated to the graph and dropped the entity, leaving the
  analyst to find the node by eye. Both the typed form (`host:WIN-DC01`) and
  the bare form `HuntView` emits are accepted, matching on node id then label.

- **Federated SIEM search has a console surface.** `/api/v1/federated/backends`
  and `/api/v1/federated/search` have fanned one query out to Splunk, Microsoft
  Sentinel, Elastic and QRadar — in parallel, against each tenant's own
  vault-encrypted credentials — for some time. `apps/web` had no client for
  either, so the capability was reachable only from the SDK. `/federated-search`
  now exposes it: pick which connected SIEMs to query, describe the search once
  in free text plus optional `field operator value` filters, and read the merged
  rows.

  The design constraint the page is built around is the endpoint's per-source
  isolation. It deliberately never fails the whole call because one backend is
  slow, 401s or 5xxs; it returns a verdict per backend instead. A UI that
  renders only the merged rows discards that, and the analyst cannot tell
  "Sentinel has nothing" from "Sentinel did not answer" — opposite conclusions
  mid-incident. So the per-backend strip renders above the rows, always, with
  each backend's own row count, latency and error message. A backend that
  failed shows no row count, because "0 rows" beside a timeout reads as
  "nothing matched". An empty result set is labelled "No matching events" when
  a backend answered and matched nothing, and "No backend returned results"
  when every backend failed.

  Recognised entities in a row deep-link to `/graph?entity=<type>:<value>`.
  Recognition is a fixed per-vendor field-name list rather than a heuristic:
  `src_ip`, `source.ip` and `SourceIP` all resolve to the same IP pivot, while
  `zip`, `recipient` and `description` resolve to none.

- **A SOC operations dashboard at `/dashboards/operations`.** `/dashboard`
  answers what is happening in the estate; this answers whether the machine
  that reports it is working. The distinction matters because every failure
  mode of a detection pipeline makes it *quieter* — a connector stops polling,
  a schema changes and events bounce, a token expires — and an alert-centric
  view reports all three as good news.

  Six panels, each backed by one endpoint and owning its own fetch, loading,
  empty and error state: connector fleet staleness (`/health/fleet`), rejected
  events by reason (`/health/dead-letters`), alert severity and disposition
  (`/alerts/stats`), detection coverage counting only *enabled* rules
  (`/detection/coverage`), agent runs/tokens/spend (`/costs/dashboard`), and
  response actions paused for approval (`/approvals`). The first three had no
  web client at all.

  Fleet staleness is reported against each connector's own cadence — "3.2
  intervals behind" rather than an absolute age, because a daily connector and
  a five-minute connector are not late at the same wall-clock time. One dead
  endpoint blanks one panel and names the failure; it does not take the page
  down and does not substitute plausible figures.

- **A real operator organisation above tenants, so the MSSP console can be
  backed by data instead of gated behind demo mode.** `/mssp/overview`,
  `/mssp/tenants` and `/mssp/incidents` returned five hardcoded companies —
  "Acme Corp, health 92.4, 12 open alerts", "Wayne Enterprises", invented
  incidents with invented assignees — because the cross-tenant aggregation
  query behind them was never written. Gating the sample behind demo mode
  removed the lie but left the feature unbuilt: outside demo mode the
  console showed zeros forever. Making it real was a schema change, not an
  ungating.

  Migration `058` adds `organizations`, `organization_members`,
  `organization_tenants` and `organization_member_tenants`, and backfills
  from `tenants.parent_tenant_id`, which keeps working. Three constraints
  hold the boundary in the database rather than in whichever code path
  writes a row: `organization_tenants` is unique on `tenant_id` so two
  providers cannot claim one customer; `organization_member_tenants` has
  composite foreign keys onto both the membership and the portfolio, so a
  grant cannot name an unmanaged tenant and releasing a tenant revokes every
  grant over it; and `organizations.home_tenant_id` cascades, so erasing a
  provider's own tenant removes the organisation while leaving its customers
  standing as unclaimed tenants.

  Roles carry two separate axes. `owner`/`admin` reach the whole portfolio;
  `operator`/`viewer` reach only tenants granted to them, and **nothing**
  when they have no grants — "no scope" degrading into "all scopes" is the
  shape every cross-tenant leak in this codebase has had.

  Every cross-tenant read resolves its tenant list through
  `resolve_portfolio_scope` and nowhere else, then passes it to
  `require_scope`, which raises rather than letting an aggregate run
  unfiltered; the list is bound as a query parameter. A `?tenant_id=` filter
  is intersected with the portfolio, so naming an outside tenant narrows to
  nothing instead of reaching out. An AST gate fails the build if a new
  cross-tenant function is added that never calls `require_scope`, and
  `test_mssp_portfolio_isolation.py` replays two organisations plus an
  unmanaged tenant against live Postgres in `integration.yml`.

  The sample rows are deleted rather than gated. `health_score` is gone
  because it was an undefined composite; `mttr_minutes` is measured from
  cases a tenant actually closed and is null when it closed none; seeded
  rows are counted separately as `synthetic_alerts` and excluded from the
  headline figures.

- **Per-tenant limit headroom, so a cap cannot throttle a customer
  silently.** A tenant that hits a ceiling raises no error anyone sees —
  alerts keep arriving and stop being triaged, which reads to an evaluator
  as "the AI doesn't work". `app/services/entitlements.py` measures
  `connectors`, `seats`, `alerts_per_day` and `triages_per_month` from real
  rows, reports `ok` / `warning` / `exhausted` per tenant across a
  portfolio, and logs exhaustion at `warning`. AiSOC ships uncapped: a key
  with no configured ceiling reports `unlimited` rather than a default
  nobody set. Ceilings come from `tenants.limits` (per tenant, wins in
  either direction) or the new `AISOC_DEFAULT_TENANT_LIMITS` setting —
  declared as a real field, because an undeclared setting is dropped by
  `extra="ignore"` and the operator who exports it gets no explanation.

- **The Splunk warehouse driver executes.** It previously raised
  `HuntNotConfigured("provider scaffolded but live SPL execution not yet
  shipped")` on every call, so the SPL every hunt was translated into was
  discarded. `app/services/spl_runner.py` carries the same three guards as the
  ES|QL runner — per-tenant SSRF allow-list, air-gap policy, row cap — and
  prefixes the translator's bare `index=…` expression with `search`, without
  which Splunk's REST API answers 400 on every hunt.

- **A playbook step that names a response verb now reaches governed
  dispatch, and says honestly what happened to it.** Fifteen of the engine's
  twenty-two step types name an action against somebody's estate. Three of
  them — `block_ip`, `isolate_host`, `create_ticket` — returned
  `{"simulated": true}` from inside the engine, reached no executor, and were
  recorded `SUCCESS`; the other twelve had no handler at all. Meanwhile
  `services/actions` held working executors for fourteen of the fifteen,
  behind a contract declaring each verb's impact, reversibility, approval
  requirement and whether a probe exists to confirm the effect landed. The
  missing piece was never an executor. The comment in `action.py` asserting
  that "playbooks dispatch step by step through this service, so every step
  is graded on the way past" described something that did not happen.

  The bridge is `services/agents/app/playbook/action_bridge.py` ->
  `POST /api/v1/playbook-steps/dispatch` -> `live_actions.dispatch()`. It
  lands in the API rather than going direct because that service holds the
  credential vault and the tenant session, and `services/actions` is the only
  place that may change a customer's estate — the same shape, and the same
  reasoning, as `siem_writeback`. **One step, one request, one grading**: a
  playbook is not approved as a unit, so authorising it cannot authorise
  whatever its steps happen to contain.

  `executed` is the single field that means a vendor was touched. A preview,
  an approval queue, a blocked action, a tenant with no integration, a
  credential-less simulation and a vendor failure are each named and each
  `executed: false`, and a step that did not execute is recorded FAILED so
  the run halts under the default `on_failure: abort`. `AWAITING_COMPLETION`
  counts as executed and `PENDING_APPROVAL` does not: collapsing that pair
  either loses an action in flight or invents one that never ran. Execution
  is off by default (`AISOC_PLAYBOOK_ACTIONS_EXECUTE`), so out of the box a
  response step previews and reports a preview.

  **`approval` is the one step type deliberately not bridged.** It is a
  pause, and the engine is a single-threaded index walk with nothing to
  suspend and nothing to wake. It is also no longer the mechanism: every
  response step is now graded individually at dispatch and returns
  `pending_approval` on its own when a human is required, so a gate in front
  of one would gate a decision that is already gated. It fails closed with
  that reason recorded rather than shipping a handler that pretends.

  **`run_playbook` as a nested step stays unimplemented, and the calculus was
  re-examined rather than inherited.** Per-step grading was the missing piece
  the previous decision named, and it now exists — but the objection it was
  the answer to does not move: a nested playbook's steps are still not
  visible where the parent declares its policy. What changed is that the
  parent no longer *needs* to bound them, because each step is graded on
  arrival wherever it came from. What has not changed is that the engine
  cannot see a nested playbook's content before running it, so an author
  cannot review what a run will do, and a cycle across two playbooks that
  reference each other is unbounded by the per-step `visited` set. Recursion
  depth and an ancestor set would answer the second; the first is a product
  question about reviewability, not a governance gap, and it is the reason to
  keep waiting.

  The schema's `x-aisoc-execution` map gains a `governed` class rather than
  reusing `executed`, because "a handler ran and made an outbound call" and
  "a vendor was touched" are different claims and the second is answered per
  run. `simulated` stays in the vocabulary: it is the class for a handler
  that answers from inside the engine, which is what these three did, and
  deleting the word would make that state unspellable rather than absent.
  `check_playbook_schema_parity.py` compares `governed` against
  `engine.RESPONSE_STEP_TYPES` in both directions, so a verb wearing the
  label while being answered locally fails the build.

- **The published playbook schema now describes the engine that runs
  playbooks, and a gate keeps it that way in both directions.**
  `schemas/playbook.schema.json` is the contract authors are told to trust,
  and it had drifted from `services/agents/app/playbook/` in every available
  direction at once. Two schema files existed with different step
  vocabularies — 15 types at the repo root, 9 under `schemas/` — against a
  `StepType` enum of 22, and the NL drafter silently fell back from one to
  the other if the primary was missing. Eleven step types were declared by a
  schema and implemented nowhere (`trigger`, `action`, `loop`, `parallel`,
  `human_approval`, `wait`, `isolate`, `block`, `create_case`,
  `run_playbook`, `script`); thirteen were accepted by the engine and
  declared by neither schema. Six step fields (`blast_radius`, `depends_on`,
  `output_key`, `retry.max_attempts`, `retry.backoff_seconds`,
  `retry.backoff_multiplier`) were declared and never read — `blast_radius`
  carried the description "engine enforces analyst approval for destructive
  steps", and the engine could not see the field at all.

  Resolved by making `schemas/playbook.schema.json` the only schema, widened
  to the full `StepType` range with the condition-as-string form the engine
  already accepted, bounds matched to `bounds.py` (3600s / 25 retries, not
  600s / 5), and the two authored-but-inert playbook keys (`inputs`,
  `dry_run_support`) declared as the documentation they are. The root
  duplicate is deleted. The schema also carries `x-aisoc-execution`, a
  machine-checked map recording whether each step type is `executed`,
  `simulated`, or vocabulary with no handler — so an author can tell what
  will happen before writing the playbook rather than after running it.

  `run_playbook` is deliberately **not** implemented as a step, on its own
  merits rather than by inheriting the argument that removed it as an action.
  A nested playbook's steps are not visible where the parent declares its
  step-level policy, so the parent cannot bound them; the engine reads no
  step-level approval or blast-radius field today, so nesting would let one
  ungated parent pull in an arbitrary tree; and twelve of the engine's own
  step types have no handler, so a verb whose purpose is to execute more
  steps would multiply that. It can return when playbook steps are graded
  individually — recursion depth and an ancestor set are the easy part.

  `scripts/check_playbook_schema_parity.py` compares the schema enum, the
  `StepType` enum, the engine's handler table, the execution map, the bounds
  module and the pack validator's trigger list — every pair in both
  directions, because the characteristic failure here is a check that asks
  only whether the schema declares something the engine lacks and never the
  reverse, which is the direction things actually drift. It carries a
  `--self-test` that injects drift each way and fails if any goes undetected,
  refuses to run at all on a tree missing its marker files rather than
  printing OK about files it never opened, and names the root, schema, step
  counts and playbook count it inspected.

- **Every `ActionType` now resolves a capability contract.** `notify_slack`
  was the last one without, and it was a naming gap rather than a missing
  capability: the verb is `notify`, it has had a contract throughout, and the
  `SlackNotify` adapter already bridged the two names. Nothing connected a
  lookup *by `ActionType` value* to that bridge, so `approval_gate` found no
  contract and skipped the confidence matrix — a 10%-confidence
  `notify_slack` was approved for auto-execution, and the verb most likely to
  auto-execute was the one graded without reference to confidence. It now
  requires an analyst under the default L1 tier.

  Closed with a one-entry alias (`ACTION_TYPE_CAPABILITY_ALIASES`) rather
  than a rename, because `action_type` is persisted operator intent:
  `remediation_whitelist` (migration 015) stores per-tenant pre-approvals
  keyed `UNIQUE (tenant_id, action_type)`, so renaming the member silently
  orphans every row an operator created for `notify_slack`. It is also a
  documented request field and a member of the `ActionType` union in
  `packages/types`. The retirement condition is recorded rather than left
  open-ended: the map goes when `ActionType` does. `check_action_contract.py`
  gains two directions — every `ActionType` must resolve a contract, and
  every alias must name a real `ActionType`, point at a real contract, not
  shadow a capability of the same name, and describe a bridge some adapter
  actually implements.

- **`scripts/upgrade_playbooks.py`, which `docs/upgrade/MIGRATION.md` has told
  operators to run since v4.** It did not exist, so the one command in the
  upgrade path that touches a customer's own content failed at exactly the
  moment it was needed. The field table beside it was worse: four of the five
  spellings in its "v4" column are rejected by the schema
  (`on_failure: {policy}`, `retry: {max_attempts, backoff}`,
  `condition: {expr, language}`, and `type: "action"`, which is not a step
  type at all), so following the doc by hand produced playbooks that would
  not validate either. Both are corrected.

  The script reports before it writes, validates its own output against the
  real `schemas/playbook.schema.json` before touching anything, and leaves
  alone any file whose upgrade would not validate. `loop`, `parallel`,
  `wait`, `run_playbook`, `action` and `trigger` are reported and refused
  rather than mapped onto a nearest neighbour — that rewrite is precisely the
  defect removed from the NL drafter, where a `disable_user` step shipped as
  `investigate`. An empty scan is a failure, not a clean bill of health.

- **Competitor product names removed from the docs portal, the benchmark page
  and the archived plan subtree, and a CI gate added to keep them out.** AiSOC
  names no competitor product, but two published comparison tables and the
  competitive-landscape section of the archived plan named eleven vendors
  outright. The analytical content is preserved everywhere: every matrix cell
  survives unchanged and every gap keeps its capability, direction and
  magnitude — only the vendor's identity is gone. The comparison columns on
  `apps/docs/src/pages/index.tsx` and `apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md` now read
  "Open-source SIEM/HIDS" and "Commercial SIEM platform"; the plan's competitor
  profiles and its five-column capability matrix now carry category labels
  ("Autonomous triage", "Hyperautomation SOAR", "Hyperscaler bundle",
  "Vendor-stack XDR", "First-line responder", "No-code automation").

  - `scripts/check_competitor_names.py` + `scripts/competitor_names.toml` drive
    the gate from an **explicit list of competitor product names**, never a
    heuristic, and allow-list the integration surfaces **by path** — connector
    modules, plugin manifests, connector docs, the connector registry, fixtures
    and tests. This matters because a vendor name is usually correct here:
    `Torq` is simultaneously a first-party SOAR connector and a name that
    appeared in a comparison matrix, so a global replace would have broken
    working connector code. Its connector, manifest, docs page and tests are
    untouched; only the competitive framing changed.
  - Both lists are checked **in both directions**. A pattern that matches
    nothing is dead and fails; an allow entry whose files no longer contain any
    of the names it excuses is stale and fails, so an exemption cannot outlive
    the code it excused; a mistyped name in an allow entry is rejected at load
    rather than silently excusing nothing.
  - A published comparison table is the one place where *any* vendor name is a
    violation, including one AiSOC integrates with, because the table's job is
    to position AiSOC against it. Those two regions are pinned by literal
    start/end markers and checked against a wider vendor list; a marker that
    drifts fails rather than scanning an empty slice and reporting clean.
  - The scan root comes from the working directory or `--root`, never from the
    script's own location, and the run prints the absolute path it walked plus
    the file count — a gate that resolves its own repository can print a
    confident OK about a tree it never inspected.
  - `scripts/check_competitor_names.py --self-test` proves the gate detects a
    known-bad sample and passes a known-good one in both directions, and fails
    if a declared competitor has no fixture. `tests/test_competitor_names_gate.py`
    adds 42 cases covering the stale-allow-list, marker-drift and dual-role-name
    properties. Wired into `.github/workflows/competitor-names.yml`, which runs
    on pull requests *and* pushes to `main` with no paths filter.

- **Tool attribution is now prevented at commit time and blocked in CI.** AiSOC
  does not attribute work to a development tool or AI assistant. An audit found
  the rule was being broken automatically: a `Co-authored-by:` trailer naming an
  editor appeared in 214 commits on `main`, and 280 of 732 pull request bodies
  carried a "Made with" or "Generated with" footer. Nothing in the repository
  caused it — no `commit.template`, no `core.hooksPath`, nothing in
  `.git/hooks/` — the editor appended it at commit time, and it survived
  `git commit --amend`.

  - `.githooks/commit-msg` strips the line before it reaches a commit. It is
    wired through `core.hooksPath`, so it is version-controlled and shared with
    every clone rather than living in an untracked `.git/hooks/`;
    `scripts/setup_hooks.sh` installs it and runs automatically as the `prepare`
    script on `pnpm install`. The hook rewrites and never rejects — a hook that
    can block is a hook that can halt someone's work on a bad pattern, so the
    blocking job belongs in CI where it is visible.
  - This is load-bearing rather than cosmetic because the repository
    squash-merges with `squash_merge_commit_message=COMMIT_MESSAGES`: GitHub
    composes the squash commit body from the branch commits, so a trailer on any
    branch commit is copied onto `main` at merge time.
  - `scripts/check_attribution.py` fails CI when attribution appears in a
    commit message, a changed file or the PR body. A human `Co-authored-by:`
    line is never flagged — a pattern only fires when the trailer names a known
    tool — and `dependabot[bot]` is allowlisted.
  - The gate runs on `push` to `main` as well as on `pull_request`. A PR-only
    check is one-directional: it inspects what contributors propose but never
    what actually lands, so anything introduced by the merge itself would pass
    it while the gate stayed green.
  - `--self-test` runs on every CI invocation and checks four directions against
    a shared fixture corpus: the gate detects every known-bad sample (so it
    cannot pass vacuously), flags no known-good sample (so it cannot pass
    direction one by flagging everything), and the hook strips exactly what the
    gate flags in both directions (so the two implementations cannot drift).
    Both read their patterns from the same `.githooks/attribution-patterns.txt`.
    The self-test earned its place immediately by catching a real hole in the
    patterns — `Built with GitHub Copilot` slipped through, because a vendor
    word sat between the verb and the tool name.

- **A model name must resolve, and the variable that routes it must be read —
  gated in both directions.** `scripts/check_llm_model_routing.py` reconciles
  `infra/litellm/config.yaml`, the role pins, the API-side mirror,
  `.env.example` and `docker-compose.yml`: every pin's alias must be defined by
  the gateway and every alias claimed by a pin; every model named in an env or
  compose file that wires the bundled gateway must be one the gateway defines;
  every variable compose points at the gateway must be read by *both* resolvers
  and every gateway variable the resolvers read must be set by compose; and a
  service handed the gateway URL must be handed the gateway key. Wired into
  `ci.yml :: python-lint`, with the self-test running first.

  Every parser is AST- or comment-aware, and the self-test proves each refusal
  rather than asserting it, because all three corpora contain text shaped
  exactly like what the gate looks for: the gateway config's commented
  Ollama/vLLM examples repeat `model_name: aisoc-triage` verbatim,
  `.env.example` documents the escape hatch as a commented
  `AISOC_MODEL_PIN_TRIAGE=gpt-4o-mini`, and `docker-compose.yml` explains the
  gateway in prose containing `OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://litellm:4000/v1` two lines
  above the key it describes. A line regex credits all three. 13 injected
  defects and 7 parser blind spots, each caught by its own code, plus the shared
  empty-tree refusal.

- **`scripts/check_orm_migration_parity.py` — a column a model declares and
  no migration creates now fails the build.** Structural on both sides
  (Python `ast` over the models and the alembic revisions, plus the raw SQL
  those revisions and `services/api/migrations/*.sql` execute) and in both
  directions: `missing-in-migration`, `missing-in-model`,
  `type-narrower-in-migration`, `type-family-mismatch`, and
  `no-migration-source` for a mapped table no migration mentions at all —
  which is the finding that exists because pairing nothing produces zero
  findings, and zero findings over zero comparisons prints the same word as
  a clean result. `--credits` enumerates what each verdict was *based on*
  for the same reason.

  Scoped structurally rather than by a list: a service that calls
  `metadata.create_all` builds its tables from the models, so a column no
  migration creates is created anyway. `services/api` is the one such
  service and is reported as advisory with its count printed, not hidden.
  The four alembic-managed services have no such fallback, which is exactly
  why UEBA's missing column was fatal.

  Verified non-vacuous against the tree as it was: it reports all three of
  the real UEBA defects. The `type-family-mismatch` kind exists *because*
  an earlier version reported only two of them — a length comparison could
  not see `UUID` against `String(64)`, since neither side declared a length
  the other contradicted.

- **`scripts/check_service_migration_bootstrap.py` — a migration chain
  nothing invokes is not a migration chain.** Asserts every service with an
  `alembic.ini` ships `app/_migrate.py`, keeps it byte-identical to the
  others, runs it from its `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT` (matched on the command lines,
  so a mention in a comment does not count), and carries both an owner DSN
  and a compose healthcheck. The other direction too: a service shipping
  the module with no chain to apply would exit 1 on every start.

- **`scripts/check_connector_profiles.py` — a connector-type drift gate that
  reads in both directions.** Nothing compared the profile keys in
  `services/ingest/internal/normalizer/normalizer.go` against the identifiers
  the connectors service declares, and they had drifted apart in both
  directions at once. The gate enumerates four name spaces — the Go profiles
  and type aliases, the 84 declared `connector_id`s, the `ConnectorType`
  union, and every `connector_type` appearing in a documented example — and
  fails when a name in any of them resolves to nothing.

  It also checks that a documented example reaches a *profile*, not merely a
  declared connector: a reader pastes a flat payload, which never carries the
  canonical envelope, so only a profile or alias can give the event a vendor
  identity. That is the specific check that catches the README defect.

  `--self-test` injects twelve defects, one per direction and per failure
  code, and requires the gate to catch each; it runs in CI on the same tree
  immediately before the gate itself. The resolved repo root, every file read
  and every count are printed before the verdict, and an input that is missing
  or parses empty is a hard error rather than a quiet pass — a gate that
  reports OK about a tree it never opened is worse than no gate.

- **The console's `ConnectorType` union is generated from the connector
  registry.** Its members were corrected in the previous release; the
  mechanism that let them drift was not. Hand-maintenance is how ten of them
  came to name nothing the platform could ingest, and `ibm_qradar` is what
  that costs: no connector declared it and no profile was keyed on it, so
  strict mode rejected those events while lenient mode minted a vendor called
  "ibm_qradar" — a second alert source for the QRadar deployment `qradar`
  already fed.

  `scripts/generate_connector_types.py` derives the union from the three
  places that decide what the normalizer resolves: the `_CONNECTOR_CLASSES`
  tuple in `services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py` (84 ids), the
  `connectorProfiles` keys in the ingest normalizer (5 more that no connector
  declares under that spelling, including the legacy `splunk_enterprise`), and
  the `connectorTypeCanonical` fold sources (5 alternate spellings the console
  still emits). 94 members, written to
  `packages/types/src/generated/connector-types.ts` as a `CONNECTOR_TYPES`
  tuple the union is taken from, alongside a machine-readable
  `connector-types.json` recording each member's origin. `connector.ts`
  re-exports rather than redeclares, and `--check` fails if it goes back to
  declaring its own — a generated file can be perfectly current and completely
  ignored while a hand-written union three directories away is what TypeScript
  resolves.

  That set is, by construction, the `resolvable` set
  `scripts/check_connector_profiles.py` already computed, so the two gates now
  share one definition instead of holding two. The fold map is emitted with
  the union as `CONNECTOR_TYPE_CANONICAL`, so the console can resolve a stored
  spelling to one product name the same way the normalizer does.

  Nothing is positional, so no lock file is needed and the
  `generate_detections.py` renumbering trap does not apply: a member *is* its
  `connector_id` and the output is a sorted set. A test reverses the registry
  and asserts the output does not move a byte. Identity is read off the class,
  the way `_build_registry()` resolves it — `jira_connector.py` declares
  `jira` and `tenable.py` declares `tenable_io`, so a filename slug would
  misname both, which is the defect `generate_connector_docs.py` shipped when
  it generated duplicate pages for six connectors while reporting 100%
  coverage.

  The `palo_alto_cortex` fold was the one entry naming a vendor rather than a
  product, and Palo Alto ships two the platform ingests. It stays on
  `cortex_xdr`: the spelling entered the union in the initial-release commit
  before either connector existed, it appears nowhere else in the tree and
  never has (no console code, no saved instance, no seed, no catalog entry, no
  fixture), the console's own catalog names "Cortex XDR" under EDR and lists
  no XSIAM, and XSIAM is reachable under `cortex_xsiam` for any deployment
  that means it. The evidence is recorded beside the map in `normalizer.go`.

- **A gate that fails when a route lets its caller name the tenant.**
  `scripts/check_route_tenant_scope.py` is an AST pass over every route
  decorator and signature under `services/` — a structural property needs a
  structural check, and the thing being looked for (a parameter's name, a
  decorator's `dependencies` list, the router object the decorator hangs off)
  survives renames a regex would miss. It fails in **both** directions: a
  route that takes a tenant identifier with no auth dependency, and a route
  that accepts one without intersecting it with the caller's scope. It reads
  request-body models too, because `POST {"tenant_id": "<someone else's>"}` is
  the same hole as `?tenant_id=` and the mutating routes carry it on the body.

  `--self-test` injects a violation of each kind and asserts both are caught
  while two clean controls pass, so the gate cannot quietly stop detecting
  things. Exemptions each carry a written reason and are as narrow as the
  facts allow: `services/mesh` is public by design (Ed25519 + k-anonymity, a
  bearer token would break federation rather than secure it); three MSSP
  routes *define* a scope rather than read within one, so intersecting would
  make them impossible; and `osquery-tls` `/enroll` authenticates with a
  per-tenant enroll secret because osqueryd has no session yet. That last
  exemption is **conditional** — the self-test strips the verifier it names
  and asserts the route is then reported, so deleting the check and keeping
  the entry fails the build. The gate resolves its repository root from `git
  rev-parse` rather than its own file location, and prints how many routes
  across how many files it opened, so an OK can be distinguished from a scan
  that never happened. `--inventory` prints the per-service table.

- **`scripts/check_gate_coverage.py` — the gate on the gates.** The most
  expensive recurring defect in this repository is a mechanism that exists, is
  tested, and has no caller on the path that needs it. A gate is the worst case
  of that shape, because a gate *is* its caller: a conformance script no
  workflow runs cannot fail, which is indistinguishable from no gate at all,
  while its presence in `scripts/` advertises coverage to everyone who reads
  the tree. Finding them had meant tracing the call graph by hand.

  This resolves the graph mechanically instead of reading workflow names,
  because a check can be reached four different ways and only one of them is
  obvious: a workflow can run it directly, through a `make` recipe, through
  another script it already runs, or through a pytest suite it collects.
  `connector_conformance.py` is reached *only* by that last route — the
  connectors matrix in `ci.yml` collects `test_conformance.py`, which imports
  the script and asserts the published matrix is current — so calling it
  orphaned, as an earlier pass did, would have been wrong. The inverse
  direction is checked too: a workflow step naming a `scripts/` path that does
  not exist cannot do what its name says.

  Wired into `ci.yml` with its `--self-test` running first, which injects an
  unreachable check, a check that loses its only workflow, a dangling workflow
  path and both ratchet-drift directions, and additionally asserts the
  resolver *discriminates* rather than returning "reached" for everything —
  the failure mode that would make every other case pass vacuously. Current
  state: **42 checks, 42 reachable, 0 on the deliberately-unwired ratchet.**

  Three checks were genuinely orphaned and are now wired. Each passed on first
  real run, which is the quiet part: they had been correct and unheard.

  - `check_store_migrations.py` → `ci.yml`. Neo4j, ClickHouse and Qdrant all
    create-if-absent, so a schema change lands on a fresh deployment and
    silently does not land on an existing one. The gate asserts each store has
    a runner, that something on the startup path calls it, and that migration
    ids stay ordered and unique.
  - `check_published_packages.py` → `readme-gates.yml`, on the daily cron
    alongside `published-onramp`, with `--require-network` so a runner that
    cannot reach a registry says so instead of reporting a clean result.
    `RELEASES.md` cited this script as the reason the README's "Ready,
    unpublished" claim cannot go stale; nothing ran it.
  - `sync_vendored_redactor.py --check` → `ci.yml`. The only one of five
    vendored mirrors with no drift gate. A redactor copy that drifts strips a
    different set on one side of the wire than the other.

- **No gate may report OK over a repository with no content, and it is a CI
  gate now rather than a probe somebody happened to run once.** Copying
  `scripts/` into an empty git repository and running every wired check there
  found five reporting OK over a tree holding nothing — the detection
  validator behind the rule count on the front page certifying zero rules as
  valid, a dashboard check that failed on an *empty* directory and passed on a
  *missing* one, `OK: 0 published Go module path(s)`, every self-link healthy
  over zero files, and a health-probe audit printing a table header and
  exiting 0. Those five were fixed; the probe that found them was a one-off,
  so the next gate written could reintroduce the defect freely.

  `scripts/check_gate_contract.py` is that probe made permanent. It runs all
  69 inventoried checks the way a workflow runs each one, inside a git
  repository holding only `scripts/`, and requires each to exit non-zero.
  Three things make the result mean something:

  - **The inventory is not written here.** It comes from
    `check_gate_coverage.py`, which already resolves the workflow-to-check
    graph structurally. A second scanner would drift the first time either
    one learned something the other had not.
  - **A failure the empty tree did not cause is INCONCLUSIVE, not a pass.**
    An argparse usage error, or an import of a module the repository does not
    supply, means the gate was never exercised — crediting that as a refusal
    would be the same defect one level up. Whether a missing module is the
    repository's own is read from `git ls-files`, so `No module named 'app'`
    counts as the empty tree working and `No module named 'structlog'` does
    not.
  - **Every way CI runs a script is probed, and the worst result decides.**
    Four subcommands under one name are four gates; excusing the set because
    the first refused is how the others stay hidden. Only invocations
    carrying a declared verdict flag are probed, so the generator half of a
    script that is both generator and gate is not mistaken for one.

  Exceptions are recorded with the disposition they are excused for and
  checked in both directions, so an entry naming a check that no longer
  exists fails, and so does one whose gate has started behaving differently.
  Four are recorded: `wet_eval_check.py` (reads two environment variables and
  no repository content), `security_audit.py`'s `validate-ignores` arm (its
  entire subject is a file inside `scripts/`, the one directory the scratch
  tree must keep), and `openapi_diff.py` / `wet_eval_update_benchmark.py`
  (both inputs named on the command line, one of them built outside the
  checkout).

- **Every check resolves its repository root from git, and every check
  carries a `--self-test`.** Sixty of the sixty-nine derived a root from
  `Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent` — whatever happens to sit two
  levels above the script — which is how a gate prints a confident OK about a
  tree it never opened, and only a deliberate run from another directory
  catches it. Fifty-four had no self-test at all. Both are now properties the
  contract gate enforces, with empty exception lists.

  `scripts/gate_toolkit.py` holds the single implementation of both. Five
  near-identical copies of the git resolution had already accumulated across
  `scripts/`, which is how the sixth gets written subtly differently.

  Two things this turned up. `check_gate_coverage.py` decided whether a script
  inspects the repository partly by looking for `Path(__file__)` — the very
  idiom being migrated away from — so moving six gates onto the shared
  resolver silently dropped them out of the inventory, and deleting their
  workflow steps would then have gone unnoticed. And the first spelling of the
  root-resolution property matched `repo_root` anywhere in the file, which
  `check_gate_coverage.py` emits as a JSON key: a gate rooted at `__file__`
  read as compliant on the strength of a dictionary key in its own output.
  Both are read from the syntax tree now.

- **Every test file in the tree is now executed by a workflow, and a gate
  holds it that way in both directions.** 63 were executed by nothing at all:
  56 of the 82 under `services/agents`, because that invocation was a
  hand-maintained list of 26 file paths; five under the repository's own
  `tests/`, which was reached only as nineteen single-file invocations spread
  across eleven workflows; and both files under `scripts/tests/`, which no
  workflow named. A file nothing runs reports nothing, which is
  indistinguishable from a file that passed.

  `scripts/check_test_discovery.py` derives the corpus from `git ls-files` and
  models reach the way pytest collects — directory arguments, `--ignore`,
  `conftest` `collect_ignore`, and `-m` marker deselection, since a file whose
  every test is deselected runs nothing however plainly it is named. An
  invocation naming a path that is not in the tree fails too. Quarantine is a
  shrink-only list where every entry carries a reason and an entry that has
  become reachable fails as stale, so "not run" can never again be silent.

  Two blind spots in the gate's own parser were found by enumerating what it
  **credited** rather than what it flagged. A step that `cd`s into a service
  and then names `tests/` had its paths resolved against the repository root,
  which simultaneously reported all 82 agents files unreached and credited the
  root `tests/` tree with a package's invocation — the same defect in both
  directions at once. And `-m` was first treated as "a filter, not a
  collection rule", which would have credited a module in full under
  `-m "not integration"` while nothing in it ran.

  The invocations are directories now. `services/agents` runs `tests/`;
  `tests/` and `scripts/tests/` run as directories in `python-test`, with
  `tests/isolation/` left to `isolation.yml`, which owns its live stores.

- **`--suite <name>` in `scripts/run_evals.py` ran every suite.** Its `--help`
  said "runs that suite in isolation", the module docstring said "run a single
  suite by name", and `args.suite` reached nothing but the wording of the
  banner: the report dict called all eleven `_run_*` helpers inline. So
  `--suite mitre_accuracy` took the full runtime, graded eleven gates, and
  printed `PASS — mitre_accuracy green` — a verdict naming one suite and
  decided by eleven, with `--ci` able to fail an operator's single-suite
  bisection on an unrelated regression. The report now carries `suite_filter`
  and only the requested suites are called; the registry is asserted against
  `_SUITE_NAMES` so a name argparse accepts cannot be one no runner answers
  to. A substrate-import failure also exits **3**, which is what this file's
  own "Exit codes" block has always documented — it exited **2**, and 2 means
  "MITRE accuracy regressed against the baseline", so a fresh clone missing a
  dependency reported an accuracy regression, and the one actionable
  instruction (`pip install -e services/agents`) was not in the message.
  All three defects were pinned by tests in `scripts/tests/` that had been
  failing for as long as they existed, in the tree no workflow ran.

- **`scripts/check_dependency_pins.py` — fails when any two install paths for
  one package disagree.** A package is installed from more than one place: a
  manifest, a lock, a Dockerfile, and whichever workflows pip-install a
  service's dependencies to run a test. Nothing compared them, so CI could
  test one version while the image shipped another. It scans 99 install paths
  and names every one of them, and it runs in six directions rather than one,
  because the recurring failure here is a gate that compares A to B and never
  B to A:

  - a package the manifest declares, installed at a different version by the
    image;
  - a package the image installs that no manifest declares;
  - two ranges written for the same package anywhere in the tree;
  - a lock resolving something outside the range everyone agreed on;
  - a critical package installed with no version bound at all;
  - a file that declares one and was never scanned — **and, separately, a
    file that was scanned but whose declaration the parser could not read.**

  That last direction found a real bug in the gate on its first run: the
  manifest parser read only runtime dependencies, so `ruff` — which lives
  only in dev groups — was reported as agreeing across seven files, none of
  which had actually been read for it. It also caught `integration.yml`,
  which installs the whole API dependency set through a folded `run: >-`
  scalar that a line-by-line reader skips while still counting the file as
  scanned.

  `--self-test` builds throwaway trees, injects drift in each of those
  directions separately, and fails if any injection goes undetected. It also
  asserts the gate refuses a directory that is not the repository, rather
  than printing a confident OK about a tree it never opened.

- **`scripts/check_toolchain_pins.py` — the Go, Node and toolchain half of
  reproducible builds.** `check_dependency_pins.py` made every *package*
  install path agree and stopped at the Python services. Go has `go.sum` and
  pnpm has a frozen lockfile, so the raw material was already there — but
  nothing compared the paths that use it, and nothing audited the *runtime*
  those paths run on. Measured across 111 install paths, and every
  disagreement found:

  | What | Before |
  |---|---|
  | `apps/web/Dockerfile` | `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` — the production web bundle was the one install path in the repository free to resolve its own dependency set, while all 13 workflows installing the same workspace used `--frozen-lockfile` |
  | `services/realtime/Dockerfile` | `npm install` twice, and `package-lock.json` never copied into the build context, so the committed lockfile was inert and every image build re-resolved |
  | `install.sh` | `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`, so a self-hoster's install could differ from everything CI tested |
  | `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile=false` — an opt-out a substring test for the flag reads as *enabling* it |
  | `deploy-docs.yml` | `pnpm --filter @aisoc/docs install`, unlocked; the published docs site could build from a tree no other job resolved |
  | `apps/web/Dockerfile` | `npm install -g pnpm@8` against `packageManager: pnpm@8.15.1` — two resolvers, the `poetry 1.7.1 vs 1.8.2` finding again |
  | Node | 20 in both images, the devcontainer, `deploy-docs.yml` and both installers; 22 in twelve workflows. Node 20 left security support in April 2026 |
  | `services/enrichment/Dockerfile` | `COPY go.mod go.sum*` — the glob makes the checksum file optional, so deleting it downgrades the build to an unverified resolve without failing |
  | `ci.yml` | `cache-dependency-path: packages/plugin-sdk-go/go.sum`, a file that does not exist. `setup-go` reports that as a **warning**, so the cache had been silently off while the job stayed green |
  | `packages/sdk-go` | compiled by no workflow at all |

  Everything above is now one version and one lockfile discipline, proved
  rather than asserted: two `--no-cache` builds of each Node image resolve
  byte-identically (web 1,172 packages, realtime 187, matching sha256 both
  times).

  Six directions, each with a `--self-test` injection that fails if it goes
  undetected — 22 cases. Beyond agreement: *ship → test* (a version an image
  ships that no workflow exercises) and *test → ship* (a version CI uses that
  no image ships, which is the direction versions actually travel); *module →
  sum* and *sum → module*; *module → CI* and *CI → module*; unlocked install
  and its reverse, a lockfile nothing can consume; and both coverage
  directions — a file declaring a toolchain that the gate never opened, and a
  file it *did* open whose declaration the parser could not read.

  That last direction earned its place immediately. Hunting for this parser's
  equivalent of the blind spot `check_dependency_pins` found in itself, five
  turned up: `cd services/${{ matrix.service }}` resolved to nothing, so five
  of six Go modules looked ungated; `working-directory:` was not read at all,
  so `services/osquery-extensions` looked uncompiled while the workflow that
  compiles it sat two directories away; the npm pattern had no left word
  boundary and matched inside every `pnpm install`; quoted shell text was read
  as commands, so `die "pnpm install failed."` counted as an install path; and
  the `node_modules` skip was a prefix rather than a path segment, so on a
  checkout with dependencies installed the gate scanned 223 vendored manifests
  and reported Node floors of `0.10` from other people's packages — an answer
  that depended on whether someone had run `pnpm install`.

  `EXPECTED_ESBUILD` pins the **resolved** esbuild set (0.25.12 bundled by
  Next, 0.28.1 from the scoped overrides). The overrides are deliberately
  per-parent because forcing esbuild workspace-wide broke Turbopack's font
  import map, and that scoping means a `vite` bump can pull a different
  esbuild with no esbuild line in the diff.

- **`scripts/check_sqlglot_pin.py` now checks the lock, not just the ranges.**
  `services/api/Dockerfile` left the list of files declaring sqlglot when its
  pip fallback was removed. The lock took its place — but a lock states a
  resolved version rather than a range, so it is checked differently: the
  version it resolved must fall inside the agreed range. Comparing the ranges
  only to each other would have left the gate agreeing about a bound that
  nothing installs.

- **`.github/workflows/reproducible-builds.yml`.** Four jobs: the pin gate
  and its self-test; `poetry check --lock` across all thirteen Python
  services; the API imported on both ends of the declared FastAPI range; and
  two `--no-cache` builds of the same commit compared package by package.

- **`Reproducible builds` now proves the property for all thirteen Python
  services, not one.** The `twice` job asserted byte-identical resolution for
  `api` alone; the other twelve used the same mechanism and nothing checked
  it. A nightly matrix (03:17 UTC) double-builds all twelve services that have
  a Dockerfile and double-installs the thirteenth, `teams-bot`, which has a
  lock but no image. The matrix is derived from the tree rather than
  hand-listed, and a `coverage` job fails when the number of services proved
  is not the number that exist — a scheduled run that silently covers less
  than it claims is the `wet-eval` failure, eight green weekly runs with every
  real step skipped.

- **`scripts/check_mypy_baseline.py` — the type check the CI job is named
  after.** `ci.yml`'s **Python — Lint & Type-check** installed mypy and never
  invoked it. Six manifests declare `[tool.mypy]` and three set
  `strict = true`, so three authors had asked for a check that had never once
  run. It runs now. The 690 findings are recorded in
  `scripts/mypy_baseline.json` exactly as mypy reports them, keyed on
  `(tree, file, error-code)` so an error cannot be introduced under cover of
  fixing an unrelated one — no `ignore_errors`, no widened config, no excluded
  tree. Both directions: a finding above baseline fails, and a *fixed* finding
  still in the baseline fails too, so freed headroom must be banked rather
  than left to absorb the next regression.

  Its first run against a rebased tree earned the gate: 22 findings — 14
  `union-attr`, 8 `arg-type` — in `services/api/app/services/playbook_step_dispatch.py`,
  a file merged hours earlier that nothing had ever type-checked. They are
  recorded rather than fixed because that file belongs to concurrent work;
  what matters is that they are now visible and cannot grow. Five other
  findings were real null-safety bugs in `services/fusion` — an
  `IsolationForest` and an `LGBMRanker` used before training, and the Kafka
  consumer and producer used before `start()` assigns them — and those are
  fixed, taking fusion from 7 to 2.

- **All twenty Python trees are type-checked, and the coverage is gated in both
  directions.** `#818` ran mypy for the first time, over the six trees that
  declared a `[tool.mypy]` table. Fourteen declared none, so the job named
  "Lint & Type-check" reported green over 787 Python files it never opened — a
  tool that appears to cover the repository while covering a third of it is
  indistinguishable from no tool at all, only more reassuring.

  Every tree now declares one, matching the two strictness shapes that already
  existed rather than inventing a third: the ten services take
  `python_version = "3.11"` / `strict = false` / `ignore_missing_imports = true`
  like `services/api` and `services/osquery-tls`; the four packages take
  `strict = true` / `python_version = "3.11"` like `packages/sdk-py`,
  `plugin-sdk-py` and `aisoc-cli`. No `ignore_errors`, no widened config, no
  `# type: ignore` added to reach a number.

  `scripts/check_mypy_baseline.py` gains the coverage check itself, rather than
  a second gate with its own idea of what a tree is. A Python tree on disk that
  declares no `[tool.mypy]` fails (`tree -> config`), and a configured or
  recorded tree that is no longer on disk fails (`config -> tree`) — the
  direction that rots quietly, because nothing ever fails when a stale entry is
  simply never consulted. Discovery is now structural, every directory holding a
  `pyproject.toml`, instead of `services/*` plus `packages/*`: the glob was a
  naming convention, and a Python tree added anywhere else would have satisfied
  a coverage gate written against that same glob while being checked by nothing.
  The gate resolves its root from `git rev-parse` rather than from its own file
  location, prints how many trees and files were in scope, and its `--self-test`
  injects coverage drift each way against a throwaway repository.

- **The 153 Python files that belong to no manifest tree are type-checked, and
  five gates that reported OK over nothing now fail.** Giving all twenty trees
  a `[tool.mypy]` table still left `scripts/`, `tests/`, `tools/` and
  `plugins/` outside every config — which is to say the CI gates themselves
  were the only Python in the repository nothing type-checked, while every
  other claim here rests on them.

  They are covered by a scoped invocation under a new root
  `mypy-unmanaged.toml`, not by a root `pyproject.toml`. Three things were
  measured rather than assumed: a root manifest carrying only `[tool.mypy]`
  makes `poetry check` answer *"The Poetry configuration is invalid"* from
  every directory without a manifest of its own, because poetry searches
  upward; pytest gains a `configfile` where it had none; and
  `check_dependency_pins.py`, `check_toolchain_pins.py` and
  `security_audit.py` all pass with one present only because each is scoped to
  `services/*` + `packages/*`, so they would miss it by accident of a glob and
  fail closed on it the day any of them is made structural.

  The scope is **computed, never listed** — `git ls-files '*.py'` minus every
  manifest tree — so a script added anywhere is checked with no edit, and
  deleting a tree's manifest moves its files into this scope rather than out
  of coverage. Sixteen `plugins/*/plugin.py` files share one module name in
  directories whose hyphens keep them from ever being packages, so the run is
  split into the minimum number of invocations with no collision, derived
  rather than configured. mypy's own `--linecount-report` must account for
  every module asked of it before the run may report clean, and a finding
  against a file outside the scope fails rather than being recorded.

  Five gates were found reporting OK over a repository containing nothing, by
  copying `scripts/` into an empty git repository and running all forty:
  `validate_detections.py` printed a warning and exited 0 over an empty
  detections corpus — the validator for the number the front page quotes,
  certifying zero rules as valid; `check_grafana_dashboards.py` failed on an
  empty dashboards directory and *passed* on a missing one, so the larger loss
  was the one it forgave; `check_go_module_paths.py` reported "OK: 0 published
  Go module path(s)"; `check_repo_self_links.py` reported every self-link
  healthy over zero files, having replaced a lychee run that could not tell a
  rate-limited 403 from a live link; and `audit_health_probes.py --check`
  printed a table header and exited 0 over zero services. Each now fails and
  says what it opened. `check_repo_self_links.py` also reported a file it
  could not decode as checked, and now names it.

  The ratchet in `scripts/check_mypy_baseline.py` gains a `file -> scope`
  direction and goes **919 → 994**: +89 newly visible, −14 fixed. Of the 89,
  20 are `import-untyped` against the deliberate no-dependency environment the
  baseline is recorded in and the rest are annotation and narrowing findings.
  A separate `--warn-unreachable` pass over the same scope reported 8
  statements, all one shape: a defensive `isinstance` guard against untrusted
  YAML or JSON that the parameter's own annotation declares impossible. None
  is dead at runtime, so the annotations are what is wrong and the flag is
  deliberately not enabled — recording those 8 would invite someone to delete
  the guards to clear them.

- **`scripts/check_logger_kwargs.py` — no stdlib logger may be called with a
  structlog keyword.** `logging.Logger.warning` accepts exactly `exc_info`,
  `stack_info`, `stacklevel` and `extra`; structlog's bound logger accepts any
  keyword and turns it into the event dict. Both libraries are used in this
  tree, so `logger.warning("x", reason=exc.reason)` is correct in one module and
  a `TypeError` in the next, and the two call sites are identical to read — only
  the binding decides.

  This needs a checker rather than a grep because of *where* it hides. All five
  instances `#818` fixed were inside `except` blocks, where the raised
  `TypeError` replaces the exception being handled and no sibling handler can
  catch it. A misused keyword on the happy path is found by the first person to
  run the code; the same keyword in a fallback runs only when something has
  already gone wrong. The report sorts by context and names how many findings
  sit on such a path.

  The scanner resolves each module's logger flavour rather than assuming one:
  every binding, not just `logger`; `self._log` and class-body loggers reached
  through the instance; `from app.core.logging import get_logger` followed to
  the defining module, because both in-repo `get_logger` helpers return
  structlog while their name says nothing; `.bind()` / `.getChild()` chains;
  annotations, including parameters, for a logger that is handed in; and
  `logging.warning(...)` on the root logger. A `**kwargs` splat onto a stdlib
  logger cannot be decided statically and is reported separately rather than
  counted as clean, and a receiver it cannot classify is counted as
  `unresolved`, never as clean.

  It covers all 1,408 Python files including the ~150 under `scripts/`,
  `tests/`, `tools/` and `plugins/` that belong to no tree and so are checked by
  no `[tool.mypy]` at all. It classifies 514 stdlib and 970 structlog call sites
  with 18 unresolved receivers, and reports zero defects — and fails outright if
  it classifies no stdlib logger, because "found nothing" and "resolved nothing"
  otherwise print the same word. Pointed at the pre-`#818` files it reports all
  five, each labelled `[inside except]`.

  Three shapes were added after the first version reported a clean tree and the
  shapes were then found *in* that tree: an inline
  `logging.getLogger(__name__).warning(...)` with no binding to look up
  (`detection_proposals.py`), a class-body logger reached as `self.logger`
  (`core/config.py`), and an annotation with no factory call in sight. All three
  were invisible to a scanner that only read assignments of a name.

- **CI now runs the interpreter production runs, and `gofmt`, `services/realtime`
  and the published image list are gated.** Three loose ends `#817` named and
  did not close.

  *Python.* Twenty-four workflows ran 3.12 while all thirteen service images
  ship 3.11. Every manifest declares `^3.11`, which permits both, so nothing
  written down was violated — which is exactly why it survived. Standardised on
  **3.11**, in 41 replacements across those 24 workflows, because 3.11 was
  already the answer everywhere except CI: the images ship it, the devcontainer
  installs it, `ruff.toml` targets `py311`, five of six `[tool.mypy]` tables set
  `python_version = "3.11"`, and all twenty-two manifests floor at 3.11 or
  below. Moving the images to 3.12 instead would have meant changing all of
  those *and* raising the published floor for seven installable packages — a
  breaking change for downstream consumers, to fix a CI hygiene problem. Testing
  at the declared floor is also the stronger guarantee. Nothing broke: 2726 API
  tests, eleven service suites at their coverage floors and three Python SDKs all
  pass on 3.11, and the mypy baseline is byte-identical (because those five
  `python_version` pins meant mypy was already checking 3.11 semantics while
  running on 3.12). `PYTHON_INTERPRETER_SPLIT` is deleted rather than emptied: a
  split that can be recorded is a split that can grow.

  *gofmt.* CI ran `go vet` and `go build` and never `gofmt`; 28 files across four
  modules had drifted. The new job walks every `.go` file rather than iterating a
  matrix, because a matrix is a list somebody has to remember to add to — which
  is how `packages/sdk-go` came to be compiled by nothing. Formatting landed as
  its own commit; nine files also had reStructuredText ``code`` markers in Go doc
  comments, which have no inline code span, so gofmt was rewriting them to two
  *left* curly quotes. The 58 marker pairs are gone, which leaves gofmt stable.

  *`services/realtime`.* Published to GHCR on every release and built by nothing
  — no build, test, lint or type-check job anywhere — despite being one of the
  two ends of the Kafka spine, carrying the OpenTelemetry instrumentation that
  keeps the distributed trace continuous, and holding the TypeScript CORS guard.
  It now has all four, installing with `npm ci` from its committed lock.
  `@types/node` moves `^20` → `^22` to match the Node 22 runtime, and a
  `tsconfig.check.json` type-checks the test file, which `rootDir: src` had left
  checked by nothing.

  Three new bidirectional pairs in `check_toolchain_pins.py` — `module -> format`
  / `format -> module`, `image -> CI` / `CI -> image`, `target -> ship` /
  `ship -> target` — each of which rediscovers its defect when run against the
  previous commit. Five parser blind spots were found and fixed in the gate
  itself, every one present in this tree: matrix legs read file-wide (so
  `ci.yml`'s two `service:` matrices merged), the block-list matrix form
  unreadable, `working-directory` truncated at the space inside a matrix
  expansion, `working-directory` unreachable when it is a step's first key, and
  `gofmt` matched inside step names and quoted `echo` strings — the last of which
  also let a quoted path in a `compose-smoke.yml` shell array count as CI
  coverage for eleven services, so the check would have reported OK about the
  very gap it exists to find. Each published image now prints the step that
  exercises it instead of contributing to a tally, and the gate asks
  `git rev-parse` for its root instead of inferring it from its own file
  location. 35 self-test cases, 49 unit tests.

- **`scripts/audit_health_probes.py` now checks the thirteen copies of
  `app/_health.py` are identical.** The module's own docstring claimed they
  were kept in sync and nothing verified it — they happened to be, so the
  claim was true by luck. It also pointed at `scripts/sync_health_module.py`,
  which does not exist in this tree.

- **A gate that reads the one place a dead path could get in.** A comment is
  the only prose no check in this tree opens: `check_repo_self_links.py`
  reads markdown and matches `github.com` URLs, lychee resolves links, and
  neither looks inside source files — which is where most cross-file
  references in this repository actually live. That is how
  `docker-compose.yml` came to name
  `docs/architecture/decisions/0001-llm-gateway-in-core.md`, a path with no
  directory behind it, and survive every gate. `scripts/check_comment_paths.py`
  reads comments in fourteen languages plus Python docstrings and asserts
  that every repository path they name exists.
  The corpus was measured before the gate was written, because a naive
  version would have been mostly noise: of **3,092** path-shaped strings in
  non-markdown comments, most are MIME types, MCP method names
  (`tools/call`), Splunk REST routes (`services/search/jobs`), container
  images or URL routes. Three structural filters — a known file extension, a
  first segment that names something at the top of this repository, and not
  a URL / template / glob / gitignored artefact — cut that to **1,251**
  claims about this tree, resolved against the repository root *and* each
  ancestor of the referring file (a comment in `services/agents/tests/`
  saying `tests/conftest.py` means the one beside it).
  Extension-less directory references are **deliberately not checked** and
  the gate says so in its own output: 286 resolve and 52 do not, and
  hand-classifying the 52 put genuine rot at roughly one in five, which is
  the precision at which a gate gets ignored.
  Ten exceptions are recorded, each with a reason and each verified in both
  directions — an entry whose path now resolves, or which no longer appears
  in any comment, fails the build rather than sitting there.

### Changed

- **A hosted deployment's hostname no longer appears in self-hosted docs as the
  reader's own URL.** Seven files under `apps/docs/` pointed at the managed
  instance: two `curl` examples told a self-hoster to push their SIEM data to
  somebody else's ingest endpoint, a sample address appeared in a console
  illustration, three white-paper links and a benchmark-scoreboard link sent
  open-source readers to the hosted console, and a JSON Schema `$id` claimed the
  hosted docs domain. These now use `example.com`, in-repo GitHub links, or the
  project's own documentation URL. Pages genuinely *about* the managed offering
  keep naming it, as does the docs build configuration.

- **The Slack bot no longer deep-links an unconfigured deployment to somebody
  else's console.** `AISOC_WEB_BASE_URL` defaulted to a hosted hostname, so a
  self-hoster who deployed the bot without setting it got case cards pointing at
  another instance. It now defaults to `http://localhost:3000`, matching the
  compose default it had silently disagreed with, and both documented defaults
  were corrected with it.

- **A permanent playbook-step failure is no longer retried as if transient.**
  `dispatch_step` raises before any I/O when the run context has no tenant,
  and the engine retried it with exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, then 8s, to
  arrive at the message it already had on the first attempt. The cost is not
  the fourteen seconds — it is that a permanent misconfiguration presents to
  an operator mid-incident as flakiness, so their next move looks like "wait"
  when it is "go and set the variable".

  `BridgeUnavailable` stays the base class every caller catches, and the
  permanent half is now `BridgeMisconfigured`, marked with a new
  `PermanentStepFailure` that any handler can raise and the engine honours.
  The line: **permanent** when the cause is this deployment's configuration or
  a violation of the API's own contract — the enable switch, the service
  token, the missing tenant, a non-retryable 4xx, a JSON body with no
  `executed` field; **transient** when the cause is reachability — a transport
  error, any 5xx, `408`/`425`/`429`, and a body that did not parse as JSON at
  all, which is overwhelmingly an ingress error page rather than the API. A
  failed step records `permanent` and `attempts`, so the run says why it was
  tried once and not four times.

- **`Backup → destroy → restore` and `docker compose up — full stack` report
  a verdict on every pull request, so both can be required checks.** Both
  workflows were path-filtered at the workflow level, and a workflow that does
  not trigger reports no check at all — so a required check would never
  arrive and the pull request would block forever. That is the only thing that
  had been standing between the disaster-recovery path being tested and it
  being tested and unable to regress; `docs/audit/CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md`
  already cited the DR job as the `GATED` evidence for backup encryption,
  which makes a gate that might not run a liability rather than a control.

  The condition moved from the trigger into the jobs. `integration.yml` gained
  a `changes` job that reads the diff once; `spine`, `migrations` and
  `upgrade` skip on it as before, while `backup-restore` always runs and
  guards its expensive steps, so the check name is produced by the same single
  job either way. `compose-smoke.yml`'s `smoke` job does the same inline. The
  DR filter was also missing `scripts/backup_crypt.py` — where every byte of
  the AES-256-GCM implementation lives — so a change to the encryption did not
  run the gate that proves the encryption works.

- **Compose smoke says which services it built and which it pulled.** It boots
  published `:main` images unless a build context changed, so a green run
  frequently never compiled the service under review — a required check that
  can pass without exercising the change is the defect this whole effort is
  about. The run now reports provenance per service, read off the images that
  are actually running rather than predicted from the decision: a pulled image
  carries a RepoDigest and a locally built one does not. It fails when a
  build-context change was detected and nothing was built, and says plainly,
  when nothing changed, that the run proves the published images still boot
  together and does not exercise this pull request's source.

  The build contexts themselves are now derived from `docker-compose.yml`
  rather than listed in the workflow under a "keep this list in sync" comment.
  A service added to compose and forgotten in that list would have had its
  source changes pulled from the registry instead of built — the gate booting
  a stale image and passing, inside the check that exists to catch exactly
  that. The derived set matches the old list exactly today, so nothing about
  today's behaviour changes.

- **The tenant-predicate gate can now tell a guard from a log line, and the
  ratchet shrank from 34 to 32.** It credited any query addressed by a key
  passed to a call that also received the caller's tenant — which
  `investigations.py` does correctly fourteen times — but a guard that logs
  and continues was indistinguishable from one that raises. The only real
  instance of the fail-soft shape was caught solely because its unscoped query
  lived in a different function; written inline it would have been credited.
  The distinction is now made structurally, and the undecidable remainder is
  refused rather than guessed: a guard whose result is tested in a branch that
  only logs demonstrably continues on failure and earns nothing; a guard whose
  callee raises is enforcing; a callee the module cannot resolve is not
  credited, so the statement becomes a finding that needs a reason.

  The gate also recognises an RLS context bound on the connection, on a table
  that carries a policy — the mechanism four ratchet entries described instead
  of a defect. Re-checking all four rather than trusting them found that none
  of the four reasons was accurate: two named a `_set_rls_context` that wrote
  the wrong session variable (fixed, and those two entries are now retired by
  the rule), and two named "a per-tenant RLS session" that their only caller
  deliberately does not use — `_purge_alerts` runs with row security *off* and
  appends the tenant predicate itself. Those two keep their exemption with a
  corrected reason. Credit granted this way is counted and printed on every
  run, because it lapses on a deployment whose role bypasses RLS.

  Two further blind spots, found by checking what the gate *credits* rather
  than what it flags: its RLS inventory globbed only
  `services/*/migrations/*.sql`, so twelve tenant-scoped tables in four
  alembic-managed services read as unprotected however many policies they
  carried; and a policy created inside a PL/pgSQL `EXECUTE` is invisible to
  it, which is why `060_rls_coverage.sql` spells out 56 literal `ALTER TABLE` /
  `CREATE POLICY` statements instead of looping over an array. And the rule
  credited the *session* as a validated key — `db` is passed to the guard and
  appears in every raw statement's expression, so `keys & resolved` matched
  whatever the query was really keyed on; a call receiver is now excluded
  structurally rather than by naming `db`. `--self-test` grew from 8 cases to
  15, covering all of it in both directions.

- **`check_gate_coverage.py` decides what a check is from what a script does,
  not what it is called.** It classified by filename — `check_*`,
  `validate_*`, `_conformance.py`, plus a hand-kept list of five exceptions
  for the ones whose names did not announce a verdict. That is the same defect
  the script exists to catch, one level up: a gate named something unexpected
  was simply not inventoried, and an uninventoried gate is indistinguishable
  from one that does not exist.

  Nineteen were in that state and every one is a CI gate. Fifteen are run by a
  workflow with `--check` — `generate_connector_count.py`,
  `generate_connector_docs.py`, `generate_detections.py`,
  `generate_slo_alerts.py`, the four `export_*` scripts, `build_marketplace.py`,
  `build_quarantine_index.py`, `curate_detections.py`, `project_stats.py`,
  `storage_cost_model.py` and two more. Deleting any of those steps would have
  left the script reporting full coverage over a smaller tree.

  Classification is now three structural signals, all read from the tree: a
  declared verdict flag (`--check`, `--verify`, `--strict`, `--fail-*`,
  `--max-*`, `--self-test`); an exit status derived from findings the script
  accumulates; or a workflow job whose output another job branches on, which
  is how `wet_eval_check.py` gates — it always exits 0 by design and publishes
  its verdict as a JSON status file. The first two are intrinsic, so a gate
  nothing calls is still inventoried and the "unreachable check" direction
  does not become vacuous.

  Polarity is the distinction that keeps it from over-reporting: `if
  offenders: return 1` is a finding, `if not specs: return 1` is a generator
  aborting on an empty read. A script that only talks to a running service is
  excluded for the same reason — its non-zero exit is an operational error,
  not a verdict on the tree.

  The classifier is checked in reverse too: a script CI runs with a verdict
  flag that the classifier does not inventory now fails as
  `classifier-blind-spot`, so the classifier cannot silently narrow. The
  inventory goes 42 → 59, and the first run of the new one found a real
  orphan — `list_python_services_with_tests.py`, whose own docstring says
  "wire this into CI itself once the matrix has stabilised" and which had
  stayed unwired. It is wired now, and passes: all 13 tested Python services
  are gated.

- **`ruff` moved to the 0.16 line across all fourteen declarations, the tree
  was reformatted under it, and the lint gate stopped ending at `services/`.**
  The bump alone reds every open pull request, because `ruff format --check`
  is a hard gate on the required `Python — Lint & Type-check` job and 0.16
  formats differently from 0.4.10. So the migration is the reformat. Measured
  under 0.16.9 (what the range resolves today, and byte-identical to 0.16.8 on
  both format and lint): **218 files reformatted**, 862 insertions against
  1075 deletions, almost all of it collapsing calls that 0.4.10 wrapped and
  0.16 fits inside the 140-column limit. It is its own commit with no other
  change in it.

  All fourteen declarations now read `>=0.16.8,<0.17` — seven manifests
  (`services/{api,fusion,osquery-tls}`, `packages/{aisoc-cli,aisoc-detections,
  plugin-sdk-py,sdk-py}`), three workflows (`ci.yml`, `ai-sdk.yml`,
  `python-detections.yml`), `.devcontainer/Dockerfile`, and the three
  `poetry.lock` files that resolve it, now at 0.16.9.

  The three lint findings 0.16 reports on `services/` are fixed rather than
  suppressed: two `C420` dict comprehensions become `dict.fromkeys` (both
  values are string literals, so the shared-value hazard the rule exists
  around does not apply), and one `UP031` percent-format becomes an f-string
  in a chunker test that counts characters — all three rewrites asserted
  equal to the originals before the change was kept.

  **Scope.** The gate read `ruff check services/`, which left `scripts/` —
  every CI gate in this repository, the code the rest of its claims are
  verified by — linted by nothing at all. That is the same gap
  `check_mypy_baseline.py` closed with its unmanaged scope, and it is closed
  the same way here: lint now covers `services/ scripts/ tests/ tools/`, the
  trees the repo-root `ruff.toml` governs that nothing else lints, and
  `ruff format --check .` covers the whole repository because formatting has
  no semantic content and `.` needs no edit when a tree is added. That
  surfaced 17 real findings outside `services/`, each fixed at the source: two
  `B007` loops switched to `.values()`, a `B904` re-raise in
  `security_audit.py` now chains `from exc` so the original traceback
  survives, two `E402` imports that genuinely follow a `sys.path` mutation
  carry a reason next to the marker, and two over-length lines were wrapped.

  Two exclusions, both named rather than implied. `plans/` is excluded in
  `ruff.toml`: it is the archived prototype subtree `codeql.yml` and
  `check_mypy_baseline.py` already exclude and the project rules forbid
  editing, and it holds 844 lint findings and ~280 unformatted files — they
  are excluded because they cannot be fixed, which is not the same as being
  clean. `E501` is ignored for `scripts/detection_specs.py` and
  `scripts/detection_specs_part2.py`: both open their rule table with
  `# fmt: off`, so the formatter is already opted out of that layout by a
  deliberate decision, and all 199 long lines there are single dict or string
  literals — 72 positive fixtures, 66 negative fixtures, 50 `match_when`
  clauses, 11 descriptions. Two named data modules, not `scripts/`; exactly
  one long line elsewhere under it needed wrapping.

  `packages/` and `plugins/` stay outside the lint gate on purpose and the
  gap is a number rather than a shrug: 91 findings and 2 respectively. Two of
  the five packages are already linted by their own workflows under their own
  configs, and bringing the three published SDKs under this gate means
  behaviour-touching fixes — `subprocess.run` check semantics, blind
  `except Exception` handling, `zip(strict=)` — that belong in a change
  reviewed as such rather than in a formatter migration.

- **`mypy` moved to 2.3.1 across all ten declarations, and the baseline it
  ratchets became reproducible outside CI.** The bump alone makes
  `scripts/check_mypy_baseline.py` exit 1 on 35 mismatched `(tree, file, code)`
  entries, so the re-record is the work — and a re-record is the moment a
  ratchet can quietly grow, so every entry was triaged before being banked.

  **Zero new findings.** All 35 are the same code in the same direction:
  `import-untyped` went 38 → 3 and nothing appeared, nothing grew. The cause
  is a behaviour change rather than a code improvement, and is recorded as
  such: mypy 2 extends `ignore_missing_imports = true` to silence
  `import-untyped`, which 1.x did not. Isolated on a two-line file — under
  1.20.2 the finding is reported with the option either way; under 2.3.1 it is
  reported only with the option off. So the ten trees that set it lose the
  "this third-party import carries no type information" signal, every one of
  the 35 was `yaml`, and `packages/aisoc-cli` — strict, with no such option —
  still reports its three. `enable_error_code = import-untyped` does not
  bring it back; `ignore_missing_imports` wins. The alternative, dropping the
  option, would surface `import-not-found` for every uninstalled dependency in
  a deliberately dependency-free run, which is a statement about the runner
  rather than the tree. Banked at 955, with the reason on the record.

  **The baseline was only reproducible on a CI runner, which is not
  reproducible.** Measured rather than assumed: the interpreter is not the
  variable people assume — Python 3.13 against 3.11 moves exactly 2 findings
  in 1 file (PEP 701 changed f-string sub-expression line attribution in 3.12,
  splitting findings 3.11 reports once) — while installing eight project
  dependencies moves 59. mypy reads type information out of installed
  packages, so a contributor with a service virtualenv active got mismatches
  in both directions and nothing saying the cause was their environment. A
  second cause surfaced while measuring the first: a `.mypy_cache` written
  under different conditions is reused by the next run, and the same tree
  answered 990 cold against 988 warm.

  Both are now closed at the source. The gate passes `--no-site-packages`
  (measured on `services/connectors`: 73 findings bare, 140 with eight
  dependencies installed, 73 either way with the flag — and a no-op in CI's
  own dependency-free environment, verified by re-recording under 1.20.2 and
  getting the committed file back byte for byte) and `--no-incremental`. It
  records the mypy version in an `(environment)` block and refuses to compare
  across majors, because a major *moves* findings and every difference would
  otherwise print as a file-level diff that describes the version. The
  interpreter difference is reported as a note rather than a refusal, so a
  contributor on 3.12 can still run the gate. Verified: the same 955 from a
  bare interpreter and from one with the project's dependencies installed.

  `mypy` is now in `check_dependency_pins.py`'s `CRITICAL` set, so the ten
  declarations have to move together the way `ruff`'s fourteen do. Nothing
  enforced that before, which is how a single-path bump could be proposed at
  all. One real bug was caught by the re-recorded baseline while this was
  being written — a `used-before-def` introduced into the gate's own
  self-test — and fixed rather than banked.

- **`sqlglot` moved to the 30 line across all eight declarations, and the
  forward-compatibility matrix leg was rewritten so it can still reach past
  the pin.** The bump itself was never the work: a single-path proposal moved
  1 of 8 declarations and left six workflows at `>=23,<27`, which
  `scripts/check_sqlglot_pin.py` fails closed on — correctly, since that gate
  exists because sqlglot 27 renamed the SELECT's FROM argument key and
  silently stripped the tenant predicate, the table allowlist and the `url()`
  exfiltration ban from every single-table query while reporting success. All
  eight now read `>=30,<31` (`services/api/pyproject.toml` plus `ci.yml`,
  `integration.yml` ×2, `isolation-live.yml`, `cross-tenant-rbac.yml`,
  `check-openapi.yml`, `reproducible-builds.yml`), and
  `services/api/poetry.lock` resolves 30.19.0 inside it.

  One major wide rather than four. The previous range permitted 23–26 and
  exactly one of those was ever exercised, so three majors were installable
  and untested; 27, 28 and 29 are likewise unexercised, and a range states
  what may be installed rather than what upstream has released.

  Measured before moving, on 64 adversarial cases written against the
  documented policy rather than reusing the module's fixtures — DDL, DML,
  admin verbs, multi-statement input, seven ClickHouse table functions
  including ones hidden in subqueries and CTE bodies, non-allowlisted tables
  reached through JOIN, subquery, UNION arm and CTE, and five forged
  `tenant_id` predicates. 26.33.0 and 30.19.0 return the same disposition on
  all 64 (23 rewritten, 33 `LakeSqlForbiddenError`, 8 `LakeSqlSyntaxError`)
  and the rendered SQL of all 23 rewritten cases is byte-identical. Two cases
  differ in wording only and both remain refusals: `DETACH TABLE` now reaches
  the statement-kind check instead of failing to parse, and `KILL`'s class
  moved to `sqlglot.expressions.ddl`, which the parse error quotes. The
  in-tree suites pass 58/58 on each major.

  The forward leg is the part that needed a decision. It read `>=27,<31`,
  which only reached past the pin while the pin sat below 27; there is no
  sqlglot 31, so with the pin on the 30 line every way of naming a ceiling is
  worse than leaving it off — `>=31` cannot be installed and reds the job
  forever, `>=30,<31` duplicates the shipped leg and reports two greens for
  one piece of evidence, and retargeting to `>=27,<30` tests majors below the
  pin, which is regression coverage for versions nothing installs and leaves
  nothing between the next major and production. The leg is now unbounded
  above, so it resolves whatever is newest and arms itself the day a higher
  major is published with no edit. Because that means it re-runs the shipped
  version today, a `Forward coverage` step emits a warning annotation saying
  so rather than letting a duplicate green pass for evidence, and
  `check_sqlglot_pin.py` gained the structural half in both directions: the
  forward leg must carry no upper bound and must not float below the shipped
  floor, and the step's `SHIPPED_CEILING` must equal the shipped range's `<N`
  bound so a stale copy cannot report the wrong verdict. Seven injected
  violations in `--self-test`, which runs before the gate. What is
  deliberately not asserted is that a higher major exists: upstream's release
  schedule is not this repository's to require, and a gate red until sqlglot
  ships 31 would be red for a reason no change here could fix.

- **Four root-workspace dependency bumps landed as one lockfile change.**
  `cytoscape` 3.34.0 → 3.34.3, `lucide-react` 1.28.0 → 1.48.0,
  `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.29.0 → 1.30.1 and `tsx` 4.23.1 → 4.23.15 all
  resolve through the single root `pnpm-lock.yaml`, so merging them
  separately makes each one rebase the next until they all report
  `CONFLICTING`. Regenerated once from the four manifests together: 47
  insertions against 56 deletions, versus 1,130 insertions across the four
  individual proposals, because each of those re-churned the same peer keys.
  The `esbuild` resolutions are byte-identical before and after — `0.25.12`
  and the `vite>esbuild` / `tsup>esbuild` / `bundle-require>esbuild`
  override's `0.28.1` — so the `tsx` bump does not reach Turbopack's bundler,
  which is the reason those overrides are scoped to named parents rather than
  applied workspace-wide.

- **Three more root-workspace bumps landed as one lockfile change.**
  `@testing-library/user-event` 14.6.4 → 14.6.7, `autoprefixer` 10.5.2 →
  10.6.1 and `zustand` 5.0.14 → 5.0.15, regenerated once from the three
  manifests together: 19 insertions against 22 deletions, versus 636
  insertions across the three individual proposals. The only transitive
  movement is `caniuse-lite` 1.0.30001803 → 1.0.30001810, which
  `autoprefixer` carries as a data table. Verified on the merged result
  rather than on the three green ticks, because none of these three has a CI
  job that exercises what it changes beyond the shared web gates:
  `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `eslint .` (0 errors), `tsc --noEmit`,
  `vitest run --coverage` (62.17% statements, gate green), `next build` and
  `storybook build` all pass.

- **Five more root-workspace bumps landed as one lockfile change.**
  `@vitest/coverage-v8` 4.1.10 → 4.1.11, `axe-core` 4.11.4 → 4.13.0,
  `react-hot-toast` 2.6.0 → 2.6.1, `framer-motion` 12.43.0 → 13.4.0 and
  `zod` 4.4.3 → 4.6.5 (the last in `services/mcp`), regenerated once: 61
  insertions against 84 deletions, versus 1,040 insertions across the five
  individual proposals.
  The `@vitest/coverage-v8` bump is the first pull request the new `vitest`
  group produced, and it closes the exact-version peer drift that group was
  added for — `pnpm install` stops reporting
  `unmet peer @vitest/coverage-v8@4.1.11: found 4.1.10`.
  `framer-motion` is a major and what installs is **13.4.3**, not the 13.4.0
  in the proposal's title, because `^13.4.0` resolves above it. Verified on
  13.4.3 rather than on the proposed number: `tsc --noEmit` passes, which is
  the gate that would see a removed API, and this app's entire framer-motion
  surface is `motion`, `AnimatePresence` and `useReducedMotion` across 37
  import sites. v13 drops the optional `@emotion/is-prop-valid` peer that
  v12 declared, and this workspace does not use emotion. 615 tests pass with
  zero errors and coverage unchanged to the digit (62.17% / 57.71% / 54.77% /
  64%), `next build` generates all 104 static pages, and `storybook build`
  succeeds.

### Fixed

- **A new user who followed only the README could not log in.** `make up`
  worked, `make smoke` passed 8/8, and then authentication was impossible for
  three independent reasons at once. The only account was `admin@aisoc.local`,
  and `LoginRequest.email` is a pydantic `EmailStr`, which rejects RFC 6761
  special-use domains — so the address returned `HTTP 422 "value is not a
  valid email address: The part after the @-sign is a special-use or reserved
  name"` *before the password was ever compared*. The bcrypt hash migration
  001 seeded matched neither the `changeme` that four documentation pages
  published nor the `admin` its own inline comment claimed; checked with this
  service's `verify_password`, every candidate returned `False`, so it
  corresponded to no known secret. And nothing existed to create a user with.
  `make demo` repaired it incidentally by writing a valid address, which left
  the demo path working and the path for running AiSOC on your own data
  broken.

  The first administrator is now created by the deployment rather than
  committed to the repository. `services/api/app/scripts/bootstrap_admin.py`
  creates `admin@aisoc.internal`, generates a password, and prints it once —
  it is stored nowhere. `make up` calls it, so the documented quick start ends
  with a credential on screen; `make bootstrap` runs it on its own and
  `make bootstrap ARGS=--reset-password` mints a new one. It is idempotent: a
  second run reports the existing account and changes nothing, which is what
  makes it safe for `make up` to call unconditionally. The address is
  validated with the same library the login route uses, so an address that
  cannot sign in is refused here with an explanation instead of becoming an
  account that fails at a login form with a schema error.

  Migration 001 no longer seeds a user at all, and `059` deactivates the
  orphaned row on databases that already ran it. A gate
  (`tests/test_first_run_gate.py`) now asserts that no migration ships a
  password hash and that every login example in the documentation uses an
  address the API accepts — the four pages were each self-consistent with the
  broken seed, which is why reading them found nothing.
  `golden-pipeline.yml` runs `make bootstrap` against the live stack and
  authenticates with the credential it printed, so the quick start's last step
  is covered by the same job that covers its first.

- **The README never told anyone to create `.env`.** `make doctor` correctly
  reported it missing and printed the fix; the quick start it was meant to
  support skipped the step. It is now the second line of the quick start.

- **`make up` printed an API docs URL that 404s.** The README was corrected on
  its own; the tooling was not, so `make up`, `install.sh`, `install.ps1`,
  `scripts/lab.sh` and three documentation pages went on telling every new
  user to open `http://localhost:8000/docs` while the app mounts `/api/docs`.
  `test_readme_api_docs_url.py` now walks the tool output as well as the
  README.

- **`make doctor` reported a port held by a foreign process as held by us.**
  The check was `docker compose ps -q <service>`, which lists containers in
  any state — so a Postgres that exited *because* the port was taken still
  counted, and the doctor printed "port 5432 in use by aisoc postgres" while
  an unrelated process had it. The two remedies are opposites. It now asks
  which host port our own container actually publishes, names the container or
  process that holds the port otherwise, and reports a service already
  remapped to a different port as fine rather than as a conflict.

- **`make up` hit port conflicts with no explanation.** `docker compose up`
  reports `port is already allocated` against whichever container lost the
  race, after a minute of unrelated output and without naming what holds it.
  `make up` now runs the port check first (`doctor.sh --ports-only`) and stops
  before starting anything.

- **The compose security note recommended a remedy that does nothing.** Both
  compose files told operators to change a host binding with a
  `docker-compose.override.yml`. Compose *appends* sequences when it merges,
  so an override without `!override` publishes the new binding alongside the
  old one and leaves the conflict in place. Both notes now show the tag, and
  `ports: !reset []` for removing a publishing entirely.

- **AI triage could not reach a model in the default deployment, and it was
  not a missing key.** `docker-compose.yml` set `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` on the `api`
  and `agents` services. Nothing read it. Both resolvers honoured only
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, which compose never set, and each carried a comment
  explaining that the refusal was deliberate — routing through the gateway
  should be an explicit choice so it is never ambiguous whether the bearer is
  the gateway master key or a provider key. The reasoning was sound and the
  result was that every `aisoc-<role>` alias went to `api.openai.com`, which
  cannot resolve one, and the caller's `except` rendered that as "no LLM
  available". `preflight_llm()` logged exactly this condition at boot with the
  remedy, so the diagnosis existed and the wiring did not.

  `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` is now the lowest-precedence base URL, and the ambiguity is
  resolved rather than avoided. **The model decides the route:** the gateway is
  adopted only for a gateway alias, which resolves nowhere else, while a
  concrete `AISOC_MODEL_PIN_<ROLE>` — the documented direct-to-provider escape
  hatch — is left pointing at its provider. **The route decides the bearer:**
  when AiSOC picks the gateway itself it sends `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`, which
  compose now supplies to both services, and never a provider key. An explicit
  `OPENAI_BASE_URL` still outranks both. The rule lives once, in
  `services/agents/app/llm/routing.py`, shared with the BYOK resolver and
  mirrored in `services/api/app/services/model_aliases.py` for the service that
  cannot import it.

  Consumers audited and fixed alongside it: the API copilot and the NL-query
  translator (both already went through the shared helpers); the agents
  **contextual copilot**, which built `ChatOpenAI(model=…)` with no base URL at
  all and reported "LLM not configured" from a key check that could not see the
  gateway's; the **detection builder** (`/nl-detection`), the only consumer that
  could not be pointed anywhere — it POSTed to a hardcoded
  `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions` with `OPENAI_MODEL`; the four API
  endpoints (translation, hunts, knowledge base, phishing) that read
  `LLM_BASE_URL` and defaulted to OpenAI without consulting `OPENAI_BASE_URL`;
  the BYOK / "explain this alert" resolvers in both services, which defaulted
  straight to `https://api.openai.com` and took an alias there; and
  `GET /llm/status`, so the indicator describes the route the explain path
  actually takes. The **MITRE RAG embedding** path is a deliberate exclusion —
  `infra/litellm/config.yaml` declares chat aliases only, so an embedding call
  routed there would 400 on every batch. It has its own
  `AISOC_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` / `AISOC_EMBEDDING_MODEL` pair and the gate checks
  the exclusion in both directions.

- **The LLM gateway moves from the `full` profile into CORE, so the documented
  default install can actually do AI triage.** It was `full`-profile on the
  reasoning that the gateway is "only needed when a provider key is
  configured" — which skipped a step: every task role resolves to an
  `aisoc-<role>` alias, and an alias resolves at the gateway and nowhere else,
  so a CORE deployment could not use a key either. `make up`, the quickstart's
  Path B, and a plain `docker compose up -d` all now start it.

  With no provider key it boots, serves its seven aliases and answers
  `/health/liveliness` (verified against the bundled config with both provider
  keys empty); AiSOC makes no LLM call and the deterministic path is
  unchanged. CORE goes from 10 to 11 services and ~6 GB to ~6.5 GB — the image
  is 1.67 GB and idles at 451 MiB, measured, so "one lightweight container"
  was not true and the README's numbers moved rather than staying put. The
  gateway is also the only party that can report what a call cost, so CORE's
  cost figures were previously unmeasurable by construction. Reasoning and the
  two rejected alternatives: `docs/decisions/0006-llm-gateway-in-core.md`.
  While correcting that table, the `full` row's service count was checked and
  was wrong: `make up-full` starts **21** services, not 30 (30 is `full` plus
  the `monitoring`, `chatops`, `extras` and `osquery` profiles).

- **`OPENAI_MODEL` replaced the triage role's model on the highest-volume path
  in the product.** `.env.example` shipped `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo-preview`,
  a model no gateway config in this tree has ever defined. The auto-triage
  worker layers a tenant's BYOK configuration over the role pin — but the
  resolver's `LlmConfig` collapsed provenance into a single `source` word, so
  the worker could not tell a per-tenant override from the process-wide env
  baseline and bound all three fields unconditionally. Once traffic reached the
  gateway that would have produced `Invalid model name` on every triage call:
  the failure the commercial deployment already hit, where the copilot and every
  triage agent degraded to empty output.

  `LlmConfig` now carries `model_from_tenant` / `base_url_from_tenant` /
  `api_key_from_tenant`, computed from state the resolvers already tracked, and
  only a field the tenant actually set is treated as an override. A real BYOK
  model still wins. `.env.example` ships `OPENAI_MODEL=aisoc-summary` — an alias
  the bundled gateway defines — and the variable is documented as the BYOK /
  explain path only, never a task role.

- **A model with nowhere to go is now an error instead of a fallback.**
  `make_chat_model` and `chat_completions_url` raise `UnroutableModelError`,
  naming the alias and the remedy, when a gateway alias is requested with no
  gateway configured — rather than building a client destined to 404 and
  letting a caller read that as "the LLM is unavailable". `run_auto_triage`
  constructs its model inside its own `try` so the failure arrives as
  `AutoTriageError` like every other LLM failure; `auto_triage_node` catches
  that specifically, so constructing outside it would have failed a whole graph
  run over a configuration problem the deterministic path handles. The
  deterministic floor is unchanged and still reports `call_count=0 models=[]
  total_tokens=0` with no `recommended_actions`. `preflight_llm()` now reports
  both directions at boot: an alias with no gateway, and a concrete model
  pointed at the bundled gateway.

- **The natural-language playbook drafter could never reach an LLM.**
  `nl_drafter._llm_factory` called `make_chat_model()`, and `role` is a required
  positional parameter; every other caller in the tree passes one. The
  `TypeError` was caught by the `except Exception` two lines down, which logged
  "no chat model available" and returned `None`, so the drafter fell back to its
  deterministic substrate path on every call, permanently, while reporting the
  condition as a missing provider. Every test monkeypatches `_llm_factory`, so
  the one line that mattered was the one line nothing exercised. Now passes
  `"nl"`, the declared role in `app.llm.model_pins`.

- **UEBA could never write a baseline or an anomaly, and said it was
  healthy the whole time.** Three separate defects on one code path, each
  reached by the first scoreable event rather than by some rare branch:

  - `EntityBaseline.peer_group_id` was declared by the model and created by
    no migration. SQLAlchemy names every mapped column in its `SELECT`, so
    the first database call `score_event` makes raised
    `UndefinedColumnError`.
  - `ueba_peer_groups.id` was created `UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` and
    declared `String(64)`, while `PeerGroupService` writes group names like
    `dept:engineering` into it — `InvalidTextRepresentation` on insert. The
    column follows the model, because the model matches the data.
  - `ueba_anomalies.event_type` was 64 characters wide against a model
    declaring 128, so an event type between the two lengths passed every
    test and failed at insert time.

  Fixed in `services/ueba/alembic/versions/0004_baseline_peer_group_and_column_parity.py`.

- **And with the schema right, the baseline still could not accumulate.**
  `_welford_update` edited the per-feature dictionary in place. Its caller
  passes a *shallow* copy of `EntityBaseline.feature_stats`, so the object
  being edited was the one SQLAlchemy had loaded from the column; by the
  time the caller assigned the result back, old and new compared equal and
  SQLAlchemy left the column out of the `UPDATE` — a `JSON`/`JSONB` column
  has no change tracking unless wrapped in `MutableDict`. Measured on a
  live stack: 36 events for one entity, every one processed without error,
  and the stored baseline frozen at `count: 1` while `window_end` advanced
  on every one. No entity could reach `min_baseline_samples` (30), so
  `compute_z_score` returned `None` forever and no anomaly was ever scored.
  The service logged `features_unscoreable` 36 times, which reads as "too
  quiet to score" rather than as a bug. The updater now returns new
  dictionaries and mutates nothing.

- **A UEBA handler exception killed the subscription silently.** The
  consume loop had no `except` at all: the first event that raised left the
  `async for`, the `finally` stopped the consumer, and the exception went
  into a task held in a module global — so it was never
  garbage-collected, asyncio never emitted "Task exception was never
  retrieved", and nothing was logged. The container stayed `running` with
  restarts 0 and `/health` answered a hardcoded 200, permanently.

  The policy is now the one `services/fusion` and `services/agents` already
  follow: **log loudly, dead-letter, and keep the subscription.** A single
  unprocessable event must not stop the stream. Refused events go to
  `aisoc_dead_letters` — the table fusion already writes and
  `GET /api/v1/health/dead-letters` already reads, with its per-reason
  breakdown — rather than to a second dead-letter path nobody would know to
  check.

- **`/readyz` reported that a consumer task had been *created*, not that it
  was running.** Three services created theirs as a fire-and-forget
  `asyncio.create_task` and called `mark_ready()` on the next line
  (`ueba`, `fusion`, `agents`). `app/_health.py` gains
  `register_subscription(app, name, probe)`; `/readyz` evaluates every
  registered probe per request and answers 503 naming the detached ones.
  `/livez` deliberately still does not consult them — wiring a detached
  consumer into liveness makes an orchestrator restart a pod over a fault a
  restart cannot fix. Each of the three also gained a done-callback that
  retrieves and logs its task's outcome, and UEBA's `/health` now carries
  `attached`, the processed / failed / dead-lettered counters and the last
  error instead of a hardcoded `{"status": "ok"}`.

- **The same audit across every other consumer.** `services/fusion`'s
  `_consume_loop` guarded `_process_message` but left
  `lake.flush_if_stale()` outside the guard, so a ClickHouse outage raising
  there would have ended the loop with the archive fault reported as
  nothing; it is now guarded and the alert path survives it.
  `services/agents`' `_process_with_retry` was already total, and the loop
  now guards it anyway rather than depending on a callee staying that way.
  `services/realtime` logged "Kafka consumer failed to start (will retry)"
  and never retried — kafkajs reports a dead consumer through its `CRASH`
  event, not by rejecting the promise, so a consumer that died after a
  successful start stayed recorded as attached for the life of the process.
  Both of its consumers now run under a supervisor with bounded backoff,
  and `/health` answers 503 listing any detached topic instead of a
  hardcoded `status: 'healthy'`.

- **A consumer that retried a permanent failure in silence, forever.** The
  `graph_ws` broadcaster in `services/ingest` could not die the way the UEBA
  consumer did — its loop `continue`s past an error — but it answered every
  error the same way: a flat 50ms sleep with the error discarded. Against a
  broker that was never coming back that is twenty reconnect attempts a
  second behind a container reporting `running`, restarts 0 and `/health`
  200, with no line in any log and no counter anywhere. Not a silent death;
  a permanent failure wearing the costume of a transient one.
  Most of those errors never reached the loop at all. `kafka.NewReader`
  falls back to a **silent logger** when `ErrorLogger` is nil, and with a
  `GroupID` set the consumer group's dial, join and rebalance failures are
  reported *only* through it — `ReadMessage` stays blocked — so the single
  most likely permanent fault, an unreachable or misnamed broker, was
  discarded inside the library. `ErrorLogger` is now wired.
  Errors are classified into what the loop can do about them: **transient**
  (retry, with exponential backoff capped at 30s instead of a flat 50ms),
  **permanent** (the loop stops, because a loop over a fault no retry can
  clear turns a misconfiguration into indefinite churn — the same reasoning
  the UEBA consumer records), and **poison** (one undecodable envelope,
  counted and skipped without backing off a healthy subscription). A fourth
  state is a duration rather than a class: a `no such host` can be a startup
  race for a few seconds and a variable nobody set for ever, so it is
  reported as transient and then, after two minutes, as *not resolving* —
  the point at which the operator's next move stops being "wait".
  Permanence is decided by an enumerated set of protocol codes, not by
  negating `kafka.Error.Temporary()`: `REBALANCE_IN_PROGRESS` is
  non-retriable in the protocol's sense and happens on every deploy, so
  deriving the set that way would have stopped the consumer on a routine
  rebalance. A test walks the entire error table in both directions.

- **Readiness that reported on the process and not on the subscription.**
  Ingest's `/readyz` now names every registered background subscription and
  its state, in the healthy case too, so a 200 says what was checked rather
  than only that nothing was wrong. The verdict stays keyed on the publish
  path deliberately: unlike the Python services, consuming is not ingest's
  job, and failing readiness for an opt-in WebSocket fan-out would pull the
  pipeline's front door out of the load balancer to fix a broadcast. The
  surface that depends on the subscription reports on it directly —
  `/v1/graph_ws/stream` answers 503 with the reason instead of completing a
  handshake onto a socket that will stay silent — and
  `aisoc_graph_ws_source_attached` / `_errors_total` / `_not_resolving` are
  the alertable signals.

- **Two scheduler loops that logged that a tick failed and never what.**
  `retention_purge` and `hunt_scheduler` logged `err=%s` with
  `type(exc).__name__` and nothing else: `err=ProgrammingError` every thirty
  seconds says a tick failed, never why, and never whether waiting is the
  right response. Both now report the sanitised message and escalate from
  `warning` to `error` once the run of failures has outlived a transient
  explanation.

- **Nothing invoked the four alembic chains.** `honeytokens`,
  `osquery-tls`, `purple-team` and `ueba` own their schemas through
  alembic; every container command was a plain `uvicorn`, so the documented
  quickstart booted them with empty schemas and none of their
  row-level-security policies. Each image now runs `python -m app._migrate`
  before its server: it applies the chain as the owner credential, takes a
  shared transaction-scoped advisory lock so four chains starting at once
  queue instead of deadlocking, reads the applied revision back, and
  refuses to start the server unless it matches head. An exit code is not
  evidence — `alembic upgrade head` exits 0 when it applies nothing, which
  is exactly what happened when the chains shared one version table. All
  four also gained a compose healthcheck; they had none, which is why a
  container that had done nothing still read as `running`.

- **Two alembic chains could never run.** `services/honeytokens/alembic/` and
  `services/purple-team/alembic/` each contained an empty `__init__.py`, which
  shadows the installed `alembic` package whenever the working directory is on
  `sys.path` — so `alembic upgrade head` failed with
  `No module named 'alembic.config'` from inside the service directory, and
  `env.py`'s own `from alembic import context` would have failed the same way.
  Removed, matching `services/ueba/alembic/`, which never had one. All four
  service chains are now verified upgrade → downgrade → upgrade against a live
  Postgres.

- **`docker compose down && docker compose up` could not bring Kafka back.**
  `kafka_data` is a named volume and ZooKeeper had none, so the second `up`
  on kept data generated a fresh cluster id and the broker refused it with
  `InconsistentClusterIdException`. `make down && make up` — documented as
  "stop the stack, keep the data" — therefore left every Kafka-dependent
  service in `created`, and only `make clean`, which deletes the data,
  recovered. ZooKeeper now persists `/var/lib/zookeeper/data` and `/log`.

- **`osquery-tls` published a container port nothing listened on.** Compose
  mapped `127.0.0.1:8091:8007` while the service runs uvicorn on 9001. With
  no healthcheck either, the container read as `running` against a closed
  socket. Found by adding the healthcheck and watching it never leave
  `starting`.

- **`docker-compose.override.yml` was committed.** Its own header reads
  "untracked, never committed": it is a QA port remap that moved PostgreSQL
  to 55432 and ClickHouse to 58123/59000, contradicting every port the
  documentation quotes. Removed.

- **The connector catalog proxy never authenticated, and served a stale list
  on every request because of it.** `_fetch_catalog()` issued a bare
  `client.get(url)` with no `Authorization` header at a connectors service
  that is default-deny on every route, so it was answered `401` on every
  single call and fell through to the catalog bundled in the API image *every
  time*. The bundle had **26 entries against a live registry of 84**. Nothing
  failed: the wizard rendered a confidently wrong list, and because
  `connector_type` is validated against that same list, the 58 connectors it
  had never heard of were rejected as "unknown connector_type".

  The proxy now presents the service credential and the tenant it is acting
  for, mirroring the fusion gateway. Every call site passes the tenant
  explicitly — it is a required parameter, not a defaulted one, because a
  defaulted parameter is one call sites forget.

  The fallback is kept, and given a stated job: **keep the console usable when
  the connectors service is not deployed or not answering.** For that to be
  defensible it has to be distinguishable from the real thing, so
  `/connectors/catalog` now returns `source` (`live` / `bundled`), `degraded`
  and `reason`. A deployment with no connectors service is `bundled` but not
  degraded — there the bundle *is* the source of truth, and flagging it would
  train operators to ignore the flag.

  While degraded, an unrecognised `connector_type` returns **503 rather than
  422**: a connectors service rolled ahead of the API image legitimately knows
  types that image does not, and "unknown connector_type" sends an operator to
  debug a connector that is fine.

- **The bundled catalog is generated, not refreshed by hand.**
  `scripts/generate_connector_catalog_fallback.py` builds it from the
  connector registry and `--check` fails the build on drift, so the artefact
  cannot fall behind the registry it copies. The gate compares **three**
  independent readings of connector identity, in both directions: what
  `_CONNECTOR_CLASSES` declares (read through the AST by
  `generate_connector_types.parse_registry`, so there is one definition of
  "the registry" rather than two), what reaches `CONNECTOR_REGISTRY` at
  runtime, and what each `cls.schema()` **advertises**.

  The third is the reading nothing looked at. `list_connector_schemas()`
  iterates the registry but takes each entry's `connector_id` from the schema,
  so a class registered as `tenable_io` whose `schema()` said `tenable` would
  be offered in the wizard under a name `get_connector_class()` cannot
  resolve — 84 independent opportunities for two declarations to disagree.
  Identity is read off the class, never the filename: `jira_connector.py`
  declares `jira` and `tenable.py` declares `tenable_io`, and `--self-test`
  asserts that property rather than trusting a comment. The self-test runs
  before the gate in CI and injects nine defects — a dropped connector, a
  renamed one, a class that never registers, a deleted artefact, an unhooked
  consumer, an empty corpus — requiring each to be caught.

- **An event ingested under a connector type with no profile became an alert
  with no host, no user and no source IP.** `_canonicalAliases` in
  `services/ingest/internal/normalizer/normalizer.go` already resolved
  `actor.user.name`, `device.name` and `src_endpoint.ip` from the spellings
  connectors actually use, but the pass that applied it was gated behind the
  canonical-envelope branch. Anything reaching the generic fallback — every
  push through `/v1/ingest/batch`, which sends a flat payload and so never
  matches that branch — resolved `title` and `external_id` and nothing else.

  Identity is what the rest of the platform is built on: entity extraction,
  the Investigation Rail's pivots, the `{tenant}:{entity}:{tactic}`
  correlation key, the entity graph and UEBA all key off those three fields.
  An alert still appeared, which is what made it look like it had worked, but
  it carried no entity chips and correlated into the `unknown` bucket. The
  alias pass now runs for every profile and fills only destinations the field
  map left empty, so a vendor profile's own mapping still wins.

  Three defects in the same family, found while fixing it:

  - **A nested vendor object was written whole into a scalar identity slot.**
    Fourteen of the 84 registered connectors emit `actor`, and four emit it as
    the vendor's object rather than a name, so `actor.user.name` became a map
    — an entity that renders as a map and correlates as garbage. Identity
    resolution now takes strings only and digs one level (`actor.name`,
    `actor.displayName`, `user.name`) for the scalar underneath.
  - **A vendor profile's severity ladder is spelled the way its vendor spells
    it.** `crowdstrike_falcon`'s is capitalised, and a pushed payload is
    whatever the caller wrote, so a lowercase `high` scored 0 and rendered as
    Unknown. The shared five-tier ladder is consulted when the profile's own
    has no entry for the value; `critical` stays its own tier.
  - **A vendor profile left `message` empty for a pushed payload**, because it
    maps its vendor's field name, so the promoter generated
    "Security Finding from <product>" over the title the caller actually sent.

- **`connector_type` values the product advertises did not reach their
  profile.** The connectors service declares `crowdstrike` and `okta`; the
  ingest profiles were keyed `crowdstrike_falcon` and `okta_system_log`. The
  README's own push example used `crowdstrike`, so the example a new user
  copies missed the lookup, fell to the generic fallback and lost its vendor
  attribution — 80 of the 84 declared connectors had no profile entry under
  the name they are registered with.

  A `connectorTypeAliases` map resolves both spellings rather than renaming
  either. The longer names are load-bearing elsewhere — `packages/types`'
  `ConnectorType` union, the CLI's default, the graph extractor, the actions
  credential resolver — so renaming one side would have broken the other.

- **Two registered connectors reached no normalization path at all.**
  `auditd` emitted `source` without `raw_event`, so it failed the canonical
  envelope check and lost the host it carries; it now emits both.
  `email_inbox` returns the message envelope shaped for
  `email-forwarded.yaml`, so it matched neither branch and strict mode
  rejected it outright; it now has a profile mirroring that template, the way
  `ai_runtime` mirrors `ai-runtime.yaml`.

- **The connector-type ratchet is at zero: ten `ConnectorType` union members
  named nothing the normalizer could resolve.** They were the console's older
  vocabulary, a third name space beside the ids `services/connectors` declares
  and the keys `connectorProfiles` uses, and they were recorded rather than
  fixed because the file was shared with console work in flight.

  Six denote a source the platform really does ingest, under a longer name,
  and now fold onto the declared id through a new `connectorTypeCanonical` map
  applied once at the top of `Normalize` — so the profile lookup, the alias
  map, `canonicalClassByConnector` and the product identity on the canonical
  path all agree on one name. The connectors' own `connector_name` values are
  what make the fold safe rather than a guess: `qradar` *is* "IBM QRadar",
  `chronicle` *is* "Google Chronicle", `syslog_cef` *is* "Syslog / CEF".

  - `ibm_qradar` → `qradar`. `services/fusion/alert_sink.py` and
    `services/actions/executors/siem.py` already aliased exactly this pair.
  - `google_chronicle` → `chronicle`
  - `palo_alto_cortex` → `cortex_xdr` (whose description reads "Palo Alto
    Cortex XDR incidents via the public REST API"; XSIAM is a distinct later
    product and stays reachable under `cortex_xsiam`)
  - `slack` → `slack_audit`, the only Slack data the platform ingests
  - `syslog` → `syslog_cef`

  Four denote nothing the platform ingests and are removed from the union:
  `vectra_ai` (no Vectra connector exists), `teams` (a ChatOps destination,
  not a source) and `custom_webhook` / `http_pull` / `kafka` (transports — the
  webhook path is the tenant inbox, which keys off a template id and never
  sets `connector_type`). Nothing in the tree referenced any of them;
  `ConnectorType` has no consumer outside its own file.

  What this cost while it stood: an event tagged `ibm_qradar` reached no
  profile and no connector, so strict mode rejected it outright and lenient
  mode minted `OcsfProduct{Name: "ibm_qradar"}` — a second, parallel alert
  source for the same QRadar deployment `qradar` already fed. The new Go tests
  assert the two spellings produce one event (same product, class, category
  and severity, with `critical` staying the fifth tier and category 2 so
  `should_promote()` has no severity floor to clear), and that the fold cannot
  be used to smuggle an unknown type past strict mode. A third test reads the
  connector ids out of `services/connectors/app/connectors/` rather than
  hardcoding them, and fails on an empty read instead of passing.

- **The dashboard published two numbers that contradicted the database, and a
  third surface that contradicted both.** A live acceptance pass measured a
  tenant with two cases closed in the last seven days at a 90-minute mean.
  `/mssp/portfolio` reported that correctly as 1.5h. The dashboard reported
  **CASES CLOSED (7D) 0** and **MTTR 0.0 hrs**, directly above its own
  "CASES OPENED (7D) 2".

  The portfolio was right and the dashboard was wrong, for two separate
  reasons that each read plausibly in isolation:

  - `cases_closed_7d` filtered `status = 'resolved' AND updated_at >= …`.
    `resolved` is an *intermediate* state — the lifecycle's terminal one is
    `closed`, and it is that transition which writes `closed_at` — so a case
    that completed its lifecycle was invisible to the count. `updated_at` was
    also the wrong clock: it moves whenever anyone edits the case, so an old
    case gets a comment and re-enters the window while a closed one
    eventually leaves it.
  - `mttr_hours` averaged `alerts.resolved_at - alerts.created_at`, a
    different lifecycle on a different table from the one the portfolio
    measures. Nothing in ordinary case work writes that column, so the
    average was over zero rows and `float(None or 0.0)` published the empty
    result as a confident `0.0`.

  Both now come from `app/services/resolution_time.py`, which owns the window
  and the SQL expression that *both* surfaces use, so the two cannot quote
  different MTTRs for one tenant again. The portfolio keeps computing its
  figure inside one bound cross-tenant statement — one round trip for the
  whole portfolio — and interpolates the shared fragments rather than calling
  the shared function; a test asserts it still does, and the load-bearing
  assertion is that the two surfaces produce the *same* number from the same
  rows rather than that each matches a hardcoded 90.0.

  The third surface was the `MTTR` tile in the Security Operations Center
  strip, reading `alerts.mttr` off `/metrics/dashboard` — the same dead column,
  and rendered with an `m` suffix although the field is hours, so a real
  1.5-hour MTTR would have displayed as "1.5m" had it ever been non-zero.

  Rather than make the three means nullable — a breaking response change for
  every existing client — each now travels with the number of rows it was
  averaged over (`mttd_sample_count`, `mttr_sample_count`,
  `mttc_sample_count`, and `alerts.mttr_sample_count`). A mean over zero rows
  is unmeasured, not zero, and the tiles say "not measured" instead of
  claiming an unbeatable response time for a tenant that has resolved nothing.
  The fields are additive: a client that ignores them sees what it saw before.

- **The alerts list was empty on every deployment, under a row count that was
  real.** `AlertListResponse` returns the rows under `items`; the web client
  read `raw.alerts`, which is never present, so `Array.isArray(undefined)` was
  false and each page resolved to `[]` while `total` carried the true figure.
  The queue therefore rendered "1,247 alerts" above an empty table with no
  error to explain it, and an operator's most reasonable reading of that screen
  was that their estate was quiet. The client now reads `items`, still accepts
  the legacy `alerts` key the responder routes emit, and a test asserts the two
  halves of the contract against each other so they cannot drift apart again.

- **The entity-risk queue sent a tenant slug where a UUID was required, then
  blamed a healthy service for the rejection.** `apps/web/next.config.js`
  inlined `NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID` with a fallback of the literal string
  `'default'`. Three tenant-scoped surfaces pass that value as a query
  parameter to routes typed `tenant_id: UUID` — `/fusion/entity-risk/*`,
  `/honeytokens/*` and `/business-context/*` — and all three answered 422.

  Two things kept it hidden. `lib/api.ts` carries the correct canonical UUID
  as its own fallback, so reading it suggested the console was already doing
  the right thing; Next's inlining runs first, which made that fallback
  unreachable code. And the slug is not a dependable handle either: migration
  001 seeds tenant `…0001` with slug `default` and the demo seed renames that
  slug to `demo`, so on a seeded install the literal matched neither the id
  nor the slug. The entity-risk client also read the build-time constant
  rather than `getActiveTenantId()`, so the queue ignored both the logged-in
  user and the tenant switcher; it now resolves the tenant the same way
  `request()` resolves the `X-Tenant-Id` header.

  `components/fim/FimDashboard.tsx` is deliberately pinned to `'default'`
  instead: `services/osquery-tls` types its tenant as a plain string and
  enrols nodes under that literal, so this one surface is keyed on that
  service's own convention and reading the shared UUID here would match no
  enrolled node. The two tenancy models still need reconciling in
  osquery-tls.

  With the request failing, the queue rendered five invented entities —
  `jsmith@acme.corp`, `updates.evil-cdn.xyz`, "last seen 5 months ago" on a
  stack that had been up for an hour. Above them, and *outside* the amber
  banner that disclosed them, four cards read "Contributing alerts 26" and
  "Alert → Incident 13.0:1" off the same sample payload. A disclosure that
  covers the rows and not the headline numbers is decorative, so the banner
  moved above the cards and every card now reads "not measured" when its
  request fails; the derived alert-to-incident ratio is withheld whenever the
  counts it divides are unknown.

  The banner also named the wrong subsystem. It said "Fusion service
  unreachable" while fusion was healthy and the actual failure was a 422 —
  a diagnosis that sends an operator to debug something that is not broken,
  which is worse than none. It is now derived from the response status: a 422
  reads as a console bug rather than an outage, a 5xx names fusion because
  that is when fusion is genuinely at fault, status 0 reads as unreachable,
  and an unrecognised failure stays vague rather than guessing. Every variant
  says the queue is *unknown* rather than empty.

- **`/alerts/[id]` rendered a confidence of 21 as `2100%`, and negative
  evidence as `+-0.30`.** Confidence reaches the console on two keys at two
  scales: the API surfaces `confidence` as an integer 0-100, while fusion's
  `confidence_score` is the raw [0.0, 1.0] float the band was derived from.
  `normalizeAlert` accepted whichever key appeared first and passed it
  through unchanged, so `Alert.confidenceScore` meant one thing or the other
  depending on the payload — and its consumers guessed differently.
  `AlertDetailView` multiplied by 100; `AttackStory`, on the same page,
  divided and rendered "21/100". Each was right for one payload shape, and
  each had a passing test because its own mock used the scale it assumed.

  Normalised once at the boundary to the canonical 0-100 integer, deciding the
  scale from the *key* rather than the magnitude: a genuine confidence of 1 is
  indistinguishable from a raw score of 1.0 by value alone, so the tempting
  `v <= 1 ? v * 100 : v` would render the least-confident alert in the estate
  as the most confident. The two mocks that encoded the old scale were
  corrected with it, since sample data on a different scale than the real
  payload is what hid the bug.

  The rationale rows hardcoded a `+` prefix on a signed contribution, so a
  factor that argued *against* the verdict read `+-0.30`; they now carry one
  sign, matching the glyphs the narrative builder uses. Those rows also
  clamped `contribution / weight` into [0, 1], which rendered every negative
  factor at zero width — an invisible bar beside a nonsense label. Width now
  follows the magnitude and colour follows the sign.

- **Every entity chip in the Investigation Rail was a 404.**
  `alert_rail.py` built its pivots as `/attack-graph?entity=…` and there has
  never been an `attack-graph` route, so host, user, asset, IP and domain chips
  all failed before the query parameter mattered. The rail's own docstring
  described the working behaviour ("the same `?entity=` query the
  AttackGraphView already parses"), and `pivot.ts` states as fact that the rail
  emits `/graph?entity=…`; the code agreed with neither. Pivots now target
  `/graph`, which reads the parameter and selects the node.

  The existing test pinned all six strings under a docstring claiming the pin
  "prevents an accidental rename". It cannot — it compares the producer against
  a copy of itself, which is how a route that never existed stayed asserted.
  `services/api/tests/test_pivot_routes_resolve.py` derives the route table
  from `apps/web/src/app` and checks it against what `build_related_entities`
  actually returns, so the comparison now runs in the direction that drifts.

  The same test caught a second defect in the producer: values went into the
  URL unencoded, so an asset named `Finance & Legal #2` pivoted to
  `Finance & Legal` and looked like it had worked. Values are now encoded the
  way `pivot.ts` encodes them.

- **The Investigation Rail's Details tab showed analysts the markup.**
  `build_narrative` documents its output as markdown-light — `**bold**`,
  backtick code spans, `- ` bullets, blank-line paragraphs — and the rail put
  the string in a `whitespace-pre-wrap` paragraph, which preserves the
  newlines and the asterisks alike. The panel read `**Medium** alert: … on
  **Finance & Legal #2**`.

  `components/alerts/NarrativeMarkdown.tsx` renders exactly that dialect and
  nothing more; an unrecognised construct falls through as literal text rather
  than being dropped. It builds React elements, never markup: the narrative
  embeds the alert title and entity names, which originate in connector
  payloads, so an HTML path here would make anyone who can name a host an XSS
  author. It introduces no heading, leaving the page's heading order intact.

- **Six funnel metrics were published as zero whatever the database held.**
  `_funnel_window` merges `_triage_quality`'s output into the dict it returns,
  but the `FunnelMetrics(...)` call never named `triaged_alerts`,
  `abstentions`, `abstention_rate`, `ungrounded_demotions`,
  `mean_groundedness` or `scored_verdicts`, so all six fell back to their
  field defaults on every response. A published zero is a stronger claim than
  silence: it reads as "this tenant never abstained, and nothing was ever
  demoted for being ungrounded". The existing test asserted the six names were
  present in `model_fields`, which they were — declaring a field and forwarding
  it are different things. The replacement drives the endpoint and fails for
  any field the window computes and the response drops, including ones added
  later.

- **`false_positive_rate` and `escalation_rate` published `0.0` on an empty
  denominator.** `x / n if n > 0 else 0.0` renders an undefined ratio as a
  measured zero, and for these two the zero is flattering: "0% false
  positives" and "0% escalated" are the two best numbers on the SOC metrics
  page, and a tenant that had resolved nothing and gated nothing scored both.
  This is the same defect as the MTTD/MTTR/MTTC means that shipped a NULL
  average as a confident `0.0`, one step removed, and it takes the same fix:
  `/metrics/soc` now reports `false_positive_rate_sample_count` and
  `escalation_rate_sample_count` alongside the rates, and the console renders
  "not measured · no resolved alerts in 7d" rather than a percentage. The
  fields are additive and optional, so a console running against an older API
  keeps its previous behaviour rather than blanking the tiles — a paired test
  holds that direction too, because "blank everything" would be a worse
  regression than the bug.

- **The connector fleet badge claimed every source was reporting when none
  was.** `ConnectorFleetPanel` rendered the badge whenever the endpoint
  answered, and with zero connectors `failed + degraded` is zero — so a green
  "All sources reporting" sat directly above the panel's own "No connectors
  configured". Zero sources reporting is not the same statement as all of
  them reporting, and the green is the part an operator scans for. There is
  now no badge until there is a fleet, and when there is one it names the
  count it is vouching for.

- **Two dashboards published fabricated security data as tenant state.**
  `DashboardView` and `SOCMetricsDashboard` both wrapped their SWR
  `fallbackData` in `demoFallback()`, which is `undefined` outside the hosted
  demo — and both then defeated that gate a few lines later with an
  unconditional `const resolved = isValid ? data : MOCK`. The mock was
  therefore exactly what rendered during first paint and after any API error,
  which for a self-hoster with an empty or unreachable backend is the whole
  session.

  What that put on screen as the reader's own numbers: a connector inventory
  they do not run (`CrowdStrike EDR`, 412 events), a MITRE tactic ranking, a
  24-hour alert-volume curve, MTTD 1.4h / MTTR 6.2h, and an LLM spend line of
  $76.65 naming three models they had never configured. Three "vs yesterday"
  trend deltas sat beside the real alert counts as literals — `/metrics/dashboard`
  publishes no period-over-period comparison, so there was nothing to derive
  them from.

  Every panel now renders one of three honest states: real figures, an empty
  state naming what would populate it, or an error state carrying the failure
  and a retry that re-issues the request. Sample data still populates the
  hosted demo, which is the only reason it exists.

- **The MSSP console showed six invented tenants and made no API call at all.**
  `MSSPDashboardView.tsx` declared `const TENANTS = [...]` — "Acme Financial",
  "GlobalRetail Corp", "MedSecure Health" and three more, with invented alert
  counts, MTTD/MTTR figures, risk scores, analyst headcounts and ARR — handed
  it to `useState`, and never fetched anything. Every operator on every
  deployment saw the same six rows, permanently, with no state in which they
  would not. The "Export Report" button raised a success toast and did nothing.

  It now reads `GET /api/v1/mssp/portfolio` and
  `GET /api/v1/mssp/portfolio/alerts` with no sample-data fallback and no SWR
  `fallbackData` (supplying it disables revalidation, so a placeholder becomes
  what the view permanently shows). Four states, each saying which it is:
  loading; a `403` explained as "you do not manage any tenants" rather than an
  outage; a portfolio failure surfaced with its message and a retry; and an
  empty portfolio that distinguishes "this organisation manages no tenants"
  from "you were granted none" using `portfolio_wide` and `scoped_tenants`,
  because those have different fixes. The alert feed has its own states so a
  failure there does not claim the portfolio is down. Export now writes a CSV
  of the rows on screen — a real action rather than a toast.

  **ARR, risk score and analyst allocation are gone, not sourced.** There is no
  revenue, composite-risk or analyst-allocation data anywhere in this product.
  A column of nulls would still imply the measurement exists.

- **`/analytics/team` ranked six invented analysts by invented accuracy.**
  "Sarah Chen, 47 cases closed, 96.2% accuracy, score 945" and five more, plus
  a highlights feed of things that never happened. Nothing in the platform
  measures per-analyst performance — no route, no table, no column — so the
  sample is confined to the hosted demo via `canUseDemoData()` and everyone
  else is told plainly that the measurement does not exist yet. The aggregate
  tiles read `—` rather than dividing by zero.

- **`apps/web/src/components/landing/MitreStrip.tsx` is deleted.** Its twelve
  ATT&CK tactic tiles carried unsourced coverage counts — 27 of 42 for Defense
  Evasion, 9 of 11 for Initial Access — that correspond to nothing in the
  tree. The component was imported nowhere and rendered on no route: the
  landing page composes fifteen sections and this was not one of them, so the
  caveat in its body copy was the only thing between those numbers and a
  reader, and it would have stopped being so the moment somebody mounted the
  section. Improving the disclaimer would have left the numbers in place for
  the next person to inherit. Its entry in `ALLOWED_ILLUSTRATIVE` goes with
  it; `scripts/check_mock_data_gated.py` checks that allow-list in both
  directions, so a stale exemption fails the build rather than accumulating as
  cover. The one MITRE figure the project does publish — 97.0% in
  `BenchmarkBand` — is labelled "substrate" and is unchanged.

- **The welcome banner quoted counts it had no source for and linked to a case
  most deployments do not have.** It advertised "26 vendors" against a registry
  of 84 and "25 named runbooks" with nothing holding either to the tree. The
  connector figure now comes from `CONNECTOR_COUNT`, which is generated from
  the connector registry and held to it by `scripts/generate_connector_count.py
  --check`; the playbook figure is gone rather than guessed, because no
  equivalent source exists. Its second call to action linked to
  `/cases/INC-RT-001`, which exists only after the demo seed has run, so on
  every other deployment the banner's own CTA was a dead link — that tip is now
  gated on demo mode, takes its href from `demoDeeplink()` and says on its face
  that it is sample data.

- **The Live Feed labelled an empty panel "Demo".** The seeded events were
  gated behind `canUseDemoData()` in an earlier pass but `statusToLabel` was
  not, so outside the hosted demo the panel rendered nothing at all under a
  "Demo" pill whose tooltip read "showing demo data" — asserting the presence
  of sample data that had just been correctly withheld. The pill now describes
  what is on screen (`Live`, `Connected`, `Connecting…`, `Reconnecting…`,
  `Offline`) and can only say `Demo` when seeded events are actually rendered,
  and the idle panel carries an empty state naming what would fill it.

- **The fabricated-data gate could not see either of the two worst cases.**
  `scripts/check_mock_data_gated.py` recognised only mock data that announces
  itself: all three of its patterns required a `MOCK_` / `DEMO_` name *and* an
  assignment through a state setter or SWR `fallbackData`, which models one
  situation — a view that fetches and substitutes a sample when the fetch
  fails. A dataset written inline under an ordinary name, in a component with
  no fetch at all, matched nothing; and with no fetch there was no real path
  for a fallback to fall back *from*, which is the worse defect, not the
  lesser one. The gate reported "All sample-data fallbacks are gated behind
  demo mode" while both fabricated tables shipped.

  A third check looks for what makes fabricated domain data harmful rather
  than for what an author happened to call it: a module-scope array of records
  that names an entity a customer would recognise — a company, a person, a
  host, an IP, an address — *and* attaches numbers to it. Numeric keys that
  describe how something is drawn are excluded, which is what keeps it quiet:
  93 module-scope object arrays in the console, 7 matched, and the 4 already
  behind `demoFallback()` were the mocks. It newly caught
  `MSSPDashboardView.tsx` and `TeamAnalyticsView.tsx`.

  The reviewed-exception list is checked in **both** directions: an entry that
  no longer matches anything fails the gate, so an exemption cannot outlive the
  code it excused and become cover for whatever is written next under that
  name. One entry, `MitreStrip.tsx` — a public landing-page illustration whose
  visible copy already tells the reader the tiles are illustrative.
  `tests/test_mock_data_gate.py` covers both properties, including that filter
  lists, graph stylesheets, decorative SVG coordinates and pricing copy stay
  unflagged; a gate that cries wolf on every configuration array gets deleted,
  which is worse than the gap.

- **`SavedViewsBar` updated its parent while rendering.** The auto-apply of a
  default saved view ran in the render body and called `onApply`, which for
  every caller is a setState on the page component. React rejects that outright
  and makes no promise about processing the update, so the filters an analyst
  expected restored were not reliably applied. The comment described a ref-flag
  that did not exist; it was `useState` with no effect anywhere. The chip
  highlight is now derived rather than stored, and the one genuine side effect
  — handing the filters to the page — happens in an effect. The existing
  "exactly once" test could not catch this because its `onApply` was a bare
  spy that set no state; the new test uses a real parent.

- **A self-hosted install handed its own users links into the maintainers'
  deployment.** Beyond the CORS and demo-credential entries above, ten shipped
  defaults resolved to the hosted host when left unconfigured, so an operator
  who never set an override sent their users somewhere else:

  - `getPublicSiteUrl()` (`apps/web/src/lib/site.ts`) fell back to the hosted
    origin, which is the `metadataBase` for the whole app — every canonical
    tag, Open Graph URL, JSON-LD block and sitemap entry on a self-hosted
    console pointed at another deployment. Now `http://localhost:3000`. The
    hosted brand was also carried in `DISCOVERY_KEYWORDS`, the root layout's
    OG/Twitter descriptions, its `sameAs`, and the PWA manifest description.
  - Published investigation replays built share links from a module constant
    `https://tryaisoc.com/r`, and tenant invite links had **two** independent
    hard-coded defaults — one on the endpoint, one on the provisioner — free to
    drift apart, which is the part that makes this hard to notice. Both now
    resolve through a single `console_base_url()` reading
    `CONSOLE_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, with a documented deployment-neutral fallback.
  - Approval email defaulted to a `From:` on the hosted domain, which fails
    SPF/DKIM for anyone else. It now prefers the operator's own
    `MAILGUN_DOMAIN`.
  - `plugins/aisoc-direct/plugin.yaml` pre-filled the hosted osquery endpoint
    as the field default; `services/osquery-tls` declared a hosted
    `public_hostname` (and had no reader at all — the comment claimed a use it
    did not have).
  - The simulation-mode call to action pointed operators at docs on the hosted
    domain rather than the project's own documentation site.
  - The GitHub Action's PR comment hotlinked a badge served by the hosted
    deployment, in the same line that promises "no data leaves your CI"; the
    report card's coverage footer linked the hosted tool while its sibling
    already linked the repository.
  - `playwright.config.ts` defaulted one project to the hosted host and the
    adjacent project to `localhost` — same env var, two answers.

  Two admin console pages also rendered the hosted hostname as body text, and
  the demo-mode 403 told every operator "This is the public AiSOC demo at
  tryaisoc.com" regardless of where it was running.

  A new gate, `scripts/check_hosted_hostname.py`, keeps this from coming back.
  It is deliberately not "the string must not appear": the hostname stays in
  99 files that genuinely describe the managed offering — the fly/cloudflare/
  terraform deploy configs, the marketing pages, the changelog, and two
  `uuid5` namespace seeds that are compatibility constants rather than URLs.
  It pins an exact occurrence count per path and fails in **both** directions:
  a new or grown occurrence, and an exemption that outlived the occurrence that
  justified it. A stale exemption is a standing permit for a future leak, and a
  one-directional allow-list never notices one. It resolves its repo root from
  the working directory rather than its own file location (a sibling gate did
  the latter and reported a confident OK about a tree it never opened), refuses
  a tree that fails a sentinel check, treats a zero-match scan as broken rather
  than clean, and ships a `--self-test` proving the detector separates a
  known-bad from a known-good sample and that the comparison rejects a vacuous
  pass. Covered by `tests/test_hosted_hostname_gate.py` (39 cases) and
  `.github/workflows/hosted-hostname.yml`, which runs on pull requests *and* on
  pushes to `main` so an edit made at merge time cannot slip past.

- **The capability contract was not consulted on the dispatch path an agent
  uses.** `POST /actions` has run the contract through
  `approval_gate.apply_matrix` since the approval gate was fixed.
  `live_actions.dispatch()` — the registry-driven path next to it, used by
  the agent loop, the console dry-run and now the playbook engine — ran
  `autonomy_safety.decide()` and nothing else. `decide()` reads
  `ACTION_BLAST_RADIUS`, a second risk ladder keyed on `ActionType`, and for
  **nine verbs it is the weaker of the two declarations** (`block_ip`,
  `block_domain` and `reset_password` are blast `medium` against impact
  `high`; `run_script` is blast `high` against impact `severe`;
  `quarantine_file` is blast `low` against impact `moderate`). So the same
  verb was graded differently depending on which door it came through, and
  the weaker grade belonged to the door an agent uses. `dispatch()` now
  applies the contract and `approval_matrix.evaluate` — each input may raise
  a requirement and none may lower it, so switching it on cannot make
  anything auto-execute that did not before.

  `LiveActionRequest` gains `confidence`, because the matrix needs both axes
  and the request carried only one. Absent is the lowest band, not a free
  pass: defaulting permissive turns a scoring bug into an autonomous
  containment.

  Three further holes closed in the same wiring:

  - **A contracted verb with no `ActionType` skipped governance entirely.**
    `_action_type_for` returned `None` for `revoke_session` and the whole
    gate was `if action_type is not None`, so a MODERATE-impact identity
    action reached its executor with no tier check, no blast check and no
    contract applied. Those verbs are now graded from the contract's own
    impact under the tenant's tier.
  - **A tenant `force_auto` override could lower a contract that declares
    `analyst`.** `ActionContract.approval` says the tenant's autonomy policy
    "can raise this but never lower it"; the override reached AUTO anyway,
    because the contract was not in the path. It still lifts the *tier
    ceiling*, which is what it is for, and no longer lifts the floor.
  - **An execution with no probe left the verification field blank.** Probes
    are keyed on `ActionType`, so a contracted verb without one had nothing
    to record. A blank field and a confirmed one are indistinguishable to a
    reader, so the honest answer — `unverified`, with the reason — is written
    explicitly.

- **A playbook step the engine could not run reported success.** Twelve of
  the twenty-two `StepType` members had no entry in the engine's handler
  table. The run loop answered those with `{"skipped": true}` and left the
  step's status at its `SUCCESS` default, so a playbook containing them ran
  to `COMPLETED` having done nothing it said it did. `approval` is the one
  that mattered: it is a human decision point, it appears in 14 steps across
  the shipped packs, and it passed on its own — the run continued straight
  into the action an analyst was meant to authorise. An unimplemented step
  type now fails closed with `unimplemented: true` and an error naming the
  verb, is not retried (a missing handler will still be missing next
  attempt), and halts the run under the default `on_failure: abort` while
  still honouring an explicit `continue`. A dry run reports `would_fail` for
  such a step instead of a bare `dry_run: true`.

  `apps/docs/docs/concepts/playbooks.md` had documented the safe behaviour
  all along — "recorded as `SKIPPED` … so unknown actions never silently
  succeed" — and has been corrected to describe what the code now does. The
  same page described a manual approval gate backed by
  `POST /v1/playbook-runs/{id}/approve`, where "the engine pauses on the
  condition until the field flips, then resumes". No such endpoint exists and
  the engine has no pause or resume; that section now says so and points at
  the actions service, which does hold an action for an analyst.

- **A playbook run reported COMPLETED when its steps had failed.**
  `on_failure: continue` decides whether the run keeps going; it was also
  deciding what the run was called afterwards. 346 of the 380 steps in the
  shipped packs carry it, so a containment playbook whose every response step
  failed still finished green. A run that ends with any failed step is now
  FAILED, with an error naming how many and which, and the author's
  `continue` policy still governs whether the remaining steps are attempted.

- **The NL drafter rewrote steps to make its own output pass lint.** Because
  the schema declared 9 of 22 step types, `_collapse_step_types_for_schema`
  mapped the other 13 onto a "nearest neighbour" — `run_av_scan` and
  `revoke_session` both became `investigate`, `approval` became `condition` —
  keeping the original in `params.original_type`. The playbook that shipped
  said it would investigate when the author had asked to disable an account,
  and an approval gate came out as an ungated branch. The projection and its
  second validation pass are removed; the schema covers the full range, so a
  validation failure is now a real failure. The drafter's system prompt also
  restated the vocabulary by hand and had drifted from it — offering
  `webhook` as a trigger, which no validator in the repo accepts, and capping
  `retry_max` at 5 against a model allowing 25 — and is now generated from
  `StepType` and `bounds.py`.

- **The playbook lint job validated two files and reported "2/2 passed".**
  `scripts/lint_playbooks.py` claimed in its own docstring to check "any
  `*.playbook.json` files anywhere in the repo" and only ever scanned the two
  under `services/agents/data/playbooks/`. Pointed at the whole tree, 32 of
  the 62 playbooks in `playbooks/packs/v1/` did not match the published
  schema. It now scans recursively, treats finding no files as a broken scan
  rather than a clean bill of health, and no longer crashes in its own error
  path when a file passed on argv sits outside the repo.

- **20 shipped playbooks carried a duplicated tag.**
  `scripts/generate_playbooks.py` emitted `[category, *tags]` where several
  categories already lead their tag list with the category name, producing
  e.g. `["supply-chain", "supply-chain", "npm", …]`. Fixed in the generator,
  which is what the reproducibility gate diffs, rather than in the 20
  generated files.

- **`packages/types/src/playbook.ts` published a fourth playbook
  vocabulary.** A 28-member `ActionType` union (`notify_email`,
  `create_ticket_jira`, `collect_forensics`, `run_query_splunk`, …) matching
  neither the schema nor `StepType`; a `PlaybookStep.action: ActionConfig`
  shape the engine does not parse; `depends_on`, `run_parallel`,
  `blast_radius_check` fields nothing reads; and `waiting_approval` /
  `paused` run states the engine cannot enter. Nothing imports the package,
  which is why it drifted unnoticed — and is also why it mattered: it is what
  the next integrator would have built against, and the server would have
  rejected their code. Rewritten to mirror `StepType`, `PlaybookStep`,
  `RunStatus` and the dispatch report, and `check_playbook_schema_parity.py`
  now compares the published union against the engine's in both directions.

- **The agent recommended evidence acquisition the platform could not
  perform.** `capture_forensics` was an `ActionType` with no executor
  anywhere, and `services/agents/app/agents/investigation_agent.py` proposes
  it by name whenever an investigation reaches the C2 or exfiltration stage,
  with `requires_approval=True`. So on the most serious class of incident the
  product raised an approval for forensic acquisition and failed with `No
  executor found for action type` when an analyst approved it — a control
  reachable from a recommendation and dead on approval.

  It now has a Microsoft Defender arm that collects an investigation package,
  declared LOW impact and **analyst-gated**. Analyst rather than automatic for
  the reason that separated `suppress_alert` from `update_alert_disposition`
  at an identical impact tier: the question is what bounds the verb. The
  writeback is bounded by a disposition mapping that refuses to close a
  confirmed true positive; this verb has no bound at all — it collects
  whatever the vendor package contains from whichever host it is pointed at,
  and the result is a copy of somebody's endpoint in a vendor cloud behind a
  download URI. Pointed at the wrong host that is a data-handling event nobody
  can take back.

  Only Defender, deliberately. MDE's investigation package is a whole-host
  artefact bundle whose completion state and download URI are both readable.
  CrowdStrike RTR's `get` retrieves one *named file*, which is a different
  verb with a different blast radius; wiring it here would make one capability
  mean two things depending on the tenant's vendor. Without MDE credentials
  the executor simulates and says which credentials would enable it, rather
  than reporting an acquisition that did not happen.

  The probe is real and reads the package back. Acquisition is asynchronous,
  so the vendor's response is emphatically not the confirmation — it says a
  machine action was queued. `Succeeded` **and** a retrievable download URI is
  VERIFIED; `Failed` / `TimeOut` / `Cancelled` is FAILED, which is the alarm
  worth having; `Pending` / `InProgress` is UNVERIFIED, because not finished
  is not the same fact as not happening. Reading the status alone would
  certify a collection that finished with nothing to download.

- **A delivered ChatOps prompt nobody had answered would have reported as a
  completed action.** `ChatOpsVerifyExecutor` worked, sat in
  `EXECUTOR_REGISTRY`, and no live-action adapter reached it, so the only
  route to it was the legacy `ActionType` endpoint — which has no capability
  contract, no approval matrix and no autonomy policy in front of it. Leaving
  it unreachable was the right call at the time: it returns
  `ActionStatus.RUNNING` to mean "the prompt went out, nobody has answered",
  and `_to_live_status` folded everything that was not `FAILED` or a
  simulation into `SUCCEEDED`.

  The fix is the missing state rather than the exemption.
  `LiveActionStatus.AWAITING_COMPLETION` means the vendor was touched and the
  outcome is not yet known — the opposite of `PENDING_APPROVAL`, which means
  nothing ran because policy wants a human first. Post-action verification
  does not run against it, since there is no effect to read back yet. The same
  state is what evidence acquisition needed, so one addition covers both
  executors that had no honest result to return.

  Registered against Slack and Teams, LOW impact and analyst-gated. Not
  automatic like `notify` at the same impact, because `notify` addresses a SOC
  channel and this addresses the account under investigation: sent
  automatically on a true positive it tells an attacker they have been
  detected, and the verb cannot know whether the person it is asking is the
  suspect. Its dry run simulates in the adapter rather than stripping
  credentials — the base adapter's strip-and-fall-through would turn a preview
  into a failure for an executor that has no simulation branch by design.

- **Nothing compared what the agent recommends against what the platform can
  execute.** `scripts/check_action_contract.py` compared four registries
  inside the actions service and could not see a fifth: the verbs
  `services/agents` puts in front of an analyst. It now parses every
  `ProposedAction(action_type=...)` call site — including the conditional form
  `attack_path_agent` uses — and fails when a proposed verb has no executor,
  naming the file and line. Run against the tree before this change it reports
  `capture_forensics` at `investigation_agent.py:157`.

  Both exemption lists in that gate are now empty, and
  `test_capability_reachability.py` asserts that emptiness directly, so a verb
  can only be exempted by editing a reviewable assertion rather than appending
  to a list.

- **Two response verbs worked and could not be reached.** `ack_alert` and
  `suppress_alert` have had Splunk, Elastic and Defender arms since Phase 3.3
  and were wired into `EXECUTOR_REGISTRY` — and appeared in none of the three
  registries that make a verb dispatchable: the live-action adapters, the
  capability contracts, or the capability vocabulary. Governed dispatch
  answered `executor_not_found` for code that ran, which reads as a
  misconfigured integration rather than a capability nobody connected. This is
  the mirror image of a defect already fixed here in the other direction,
  where eleven capabilities had a contract and no executor at all — including
  `unisolate_host`, so the rollback for the most disruptive action in the
  product resolved to nothing.

  Both verbs now have six vendor adapters (one per vendor arm), a capability
  contract, an entry in the vocabulary on both sides of the mirror, and a
  verification probe. Each adapter pins `alert_vendor` so a tenant with two
  SIEMs configured does not have the target chosen by credential ordering; the
  pin is still checked against the credentials, so pinning a vendor the tenant
  has not configured simulates rather than claiming an arm that could not have
  run.

  `ack_alert` is LOW impact and automatic: it marks a finding in-progress and
  owned by AiSOC, removing nothing from anyone's view, and two analysts
  working the same notable is the cost of not doing it. `suppress_alert` is
  LOW impact and **analyst-gated**, because what makes the disposition
  writeback safe to automate is the mapping that refuses to close a confirmed
  true positive, and this verb has no such bound — it closes whatever it is
  pointed at, on the caller's say-so.

- **A one-directional gate would have missed all of it.** `check_action_contract.py`
  now compares the four registries a verb needs in **both** directions, and
  `test_capability_reachability.py` injects drift in each direction and asserts
  the gate names it. The dominant failure shape in this repository is a check
  that compares A against B and never B against A, so drift in the direction
  things actually change passes while the check prints OK — the graph-schema
  check reported OK with 17 node labels declared and 28 implemented.

  Running it found three more mismatches beyond the two above. `create_ticket`
  and `notify` were registered, contracted and dispatchable across four
  vendors while absent from `KNOWN_CAPABILITIES` and the connectors
  `Capability` enum, so the registry logged `capability_unknown` for them at
  every startup; both are now in the vocabulary. `chatops_verify` has an
  executor no adapter reaches, and three `ActionType` members
  (`capture_forensics`, `add_ioc_to_blocklist`, `run_playbook`) have no
  executor at all — the first of those is proposed by name by the
  investigation agent on the C2/exfiltration path, so the product recommends
  evidence acquisition it cannot perform. Those four are recorded in the
  gate's exemption lists with the reason each is open. Both lists are
  ratchets: an entry that gains an implementation and is not removed fails the
  build.

- **The disposition writeback now verifies itself against the vendor.** It
  shipped declaring no verification probe, which was honest — a declared probe
  that does not run is the defect the contract gate exists to catch — but the
  standing rule is that an unverifiable action is not an autonomous one, and
  this action is automatic. The probe re-reads the finding and compares its
  state against the plan re-derived from the same verdict through the same
  `plan_writeback` the executor used, rather than being told separately what
  to expect. Splunk ES reads back the `incident_review` collection (a new
  `SplunkClient.get_notable_event_state`) and confirms status `5` on a close,
  or status `1` *and* the owner AiSOC set on an escalation, since status alone
  cannot distinguish a notable an analyst had already picked up. QRadar
  confirms `CLOSED` through `get_offense`, whose docstring had claimed to be
  the writeback probe since it was written and had no caller.

  A QRadar **escalation** deliberately reports `unverified`: escalating leaves
  the offense `OPEN`, which is also its prior state, so confirming "still
  OPEN" would certify a write that never happened — the same shape as the
  isolation probe that returned `bool(device_id)` and would have certified an
  uncontained host. Elastic, Sentinel and Defender expose no read of a
  finding's state and report `unverified` too. `ack_alert` and
  `suppress_alert` are verified against the same read-back.

- **A dry run called the customer's production SIEM.** The live-action dry-run
  path works by stripping credentials so the executor falls through to
  simulation, and the strip list did not match what the client factory reads:
  the Splunk adapters stripped `splunk_host` / `splunk_token` / `splunk_index`
  while `_splunk_client` reads `splunk_url` *first* and also accepts basic
  auth. `splunk_url` is exactly what the credential resolver writes for a
  connector-configured tenant, so a "preview" built a real client and called
  Splunk. Elastic had the identical mismatch (`elastic_host` stripped,
  `elastic_url` read). The strip lists are now the factories' own exported key
  tuples, and a test re-derives each read set from the factory source so the
  two cannot drift again.

- **An `alert_vendor` pin was honoured without checking that vendor's
  credentials existed.** `_ack_vendor` returned the pinned vendor
  unconditionally. A dry run strips credentials, so the pin survived the strip,
  resolved to "splunk" with no client, and hit an `assert` — crashing an action
  that was meant to be a harmless preview. A pin naming a vendor the tenant had
  never configured reported a vendor arm that could not run. A pin is now
  checked against the credentials, and an unusable pin resolves to *nothing*
  rather than falling through to whichever other SIEM happens to be configured:
  "write this to Splunk" must not become "write this to Elastic".

- **`CreateNotableEventExecutor` raised `TypeError` on every live call.** It
  passed `title=` / `description=` / `fields=` to a client whose signature is
  `(rule_name, event_data, severity, owner, status)`. Invisible because
  simulation mode never constructs the client — the same defect class as the
  `max_results` / `max_count` drift fixed earlier on this module. Every SIEM
  executor-to-client call is now pinned by an autospec'd signature test, which
  a hand-written fake with `**kwargs` could never have caught.

- **Every live Okta password reset raised `TypeError` and came back FAILED.**
  `ResetPasswordExecutor` documents `parameters.send_email` as "used only for
  the Okta path", reads it, and passed `send_email=` to
  `OktaClient.reset_password(self, login_or_id)` — which did not accept it. The
  executor's `except Exception` turned the `TypeError` into a FAILED
  `ActionResult`, so the verb did not crash; it simply could never succeed
  against Okta, and the failure read as an Okta problem. Simulation mode never
  constructs a vendor client, which is why no test saw it: the one that covers
  this executor stubs the client as `async def reset_password(self, *_args,
  **_kw)`, and a fake that accepts anything proves the dispatch order and
  nothing about the call. The client now takes `send_email` and maps it to
  Okta's `sendEmail` parameter, and `test_identity_client_signatures.py`
  autospecs all three IdP clients across every executor arm — the companion to
  `test_siem_client_signatures.py`, for the third instance of the same defect.

- **The lake's tenant isolation could be switched off by resolving a
  dependency one major version higher.** `lake_sql.rewrite_for_tenant` is the
  only thing separating one tenant's events from another's in ClickHouse: it
  parses untrusted operator SQL with sqlglot, enforces the table allowlist
  against the parse tree, bans ClickHouse table functions, and injects the
  `tenant_id` predicate. sqlglot 27 moved the SELECT's FROM clause from
  `args["from"]` to `args["from_"]`. The table walk read the old key, got
  nothing, and took the branch written for `SELECT 1` — "no FROM, so no tenant
  data, nothing to do". Every single-table query then came back with no
  allowlist check, no table-function ban and no tenant predicate, reported as
  a successful rewrite.

  `services/api/pyproject.toml` declared `sqlglot >=23.0.0,<31.0.0` while the
  Dockerfile and every CI workflow declared `>=23,<27`, so this was reachable
  by installing the service exactly as declared, and CI could not see it
  because CI installed the narrow range. Verified on sqlglot 30.19.0 against
  the pre-fix rewriter: `SELECT user_name FROM aisoc.raw_events` returned
  unscoped, `SELECT * FROM system.tables` was accepted, and
  `url('https://attacker.example/x', JSONEachRow)` was accepted — the last of
  which makes the warehouse issue outbound HTTP with its own network identity.

  Three changes rather than one, because pinning alone would leave the trap
  armed for the next bump. The FROM clause now resolves by node type instead
  of by key name. `rewrite_for_tenant` ends with an audit that takes its own
  independent census of the statement's tables and raises the new
  `LakeSqlIsolationError` unless every one of them was scoped, the tenant
  survived into the rendered string, and every rendered SELECT that reads a
  lake table carries the tenant in its own WHERE — so a partially scoped
  UNION fails too. And all seven install paths now declare one identical
  range, enforced by `scripts/check_sqlglot_pin.py`, with
  `.github/workflows/lake-isolation.yml` running the rewriter suites against
  both the shipped range and the next major so a future bump fails loudly
  instead of quietly downgrading isolation.

- **Scheduled hunts ran against credentials that could not exist, so every one
  of them returned zero hits.** The event-warehouse drivers resolved their
  endpoint and secret from `settings.ES_URL` / `ES_API_KEY` / `SPLUNK_URL` /
  `SPLUNK_HMAC_TOKEN` / `CHRONICLE_PROJECT_ID`. None of those were declared
  fields on `Settings`; each was read through `getattr(settings, name, None)`,
  so the miss was silent, and `Settings` sets `extra="ignore"`, so an operator
  who followed the resulting "set them in environment variables" message and
  exported `ES_URL` got the same message back. The scheduler treats the
  resulting `HuntNotConfigured` as a soft skip, so the failure was invisible.

  Credentials now resolve from the tenant's own `connectors` row — the one the
  console wizard writes, encrypted by the credential vault — which is where
  `federated.py` and `case_fanout.py` already read theirs. The warehouse is
  per-tenant by construction as a result: a managed provider can point each
  customer at their own cluster, which resolving from process settings made
  impossible even in principle. `ES_URL` / `ES_API_KEY` are now declared
  fields and remain as a deployment-wide fallback for single-cluster installs.

- **Provider selection ignored which SIEM the tenant had connected.**
  `resolve_provider` returned the first driver whose `translated_query_key`
  appeared in the hunt, and the natural-language translator emits ES|QL, SPL
  *and* KQL for every question — so `esql` was always present and
  Elasticsearch was always chosen, including for tenants who run only Splunk.
  Selection is now driven by the tenant's enabled connectors first and the
  available translation second.

- **`POST /nl-query/execute` documented two request fields it ignored.**
  `es_url` and `es_api_key` were described as overrides and silently dropped.
  `es_url` now selects among the caller's own Elasticsearch connectors by
  host, matched against connectors they own and never used as an outbound
  target; `es_api_key` is refused with 400, because credentials belong in the
  vault-encrypted connector rather than in a request body.

- **`wet-eval.yml` reported success on eight consecutive weekly runs while
  evaluating nothing.** The preflight step exited 0, every subsequent step was
  `if: should_run == 'True'` and skipped, the notice step succeeded, and the
  job went green. A green check that means "I did not run" is worse than a red
  one: it is the only signal a reader gets and it says the opposite of the
  truth. Preflight is now its own job and the run is gated on
  `needs.preflight.outputs.should_run`, so with no funded key the benchmark
  job reports as **skipped** — visibly distinct from success in the checks
  list — and the preflight writes to the run summary that the published
  numbers were not refreshed. Failing outright was the alternative and is
  wrong here: a fork cannot configure the secret, and a weekly red cross
  nobody can clear trains people to ignore the page. Staleness of the
  published numbers is separately gated and does fail closed
  (`scripts/check_scoreboard.py`, 45 days).

- **The claim-gate figures gate checked every restatement of the tally except
  the document making the claim.** `readme_gates.py` compared the README and
  `evidence-pack.md` against the matrix rows and never compared the matrix's
  own Summary block, so `docs/audit/CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md` summarised
  "GATED: 108" against 109 counted rows and every check in the repository
  passed. The file even carries a counting note about this exact class of
  error; it recurred because the gate written afterwards pointed outward only.
  The matrix is now the first source checked, the bullet-list form its summary
  uses is matched (the previous pattern needed both figures on one line and
  silently matched nothing there), and three cases in
  `tests/test_readme_figures_gate.py` pin it. The stale count is corrected and
  the tally is **122 rows — 113 GATED, 9 PARTIAL, 0 NO GATE**, recomputed with
  the script rather than typed.

- **The OpenAPI gate's documented escape hatch did not exist.** The workflow
  header told a maintainer to "re-run with `--allow-breaking`" and
  `scripts/openapi_diff.py` claimed the flag was what "the release flow uses" —
  but the workflow triggered on `pull_request` only, with no dispatch, no input
  and no label check, and the diff step never passed the flag. `--allow-breaking`
  had **no caller anywhere in the tree**. A maintainer facing a correct,
  deliberate break had no action that worked, and the two statements describing
  the procedure were both false.

  The hatch is now a PR label, `breaking-change-approved`, chosen over a
  `workflow_dispatch` boolean because applying a label leaves an attributable
  record of who authorised the break and when on the PR timeline. The job reads
  that timeline and names the approver in its output. It re-runs on `labeled`
  and `unlabeled`, so the label is a live control rather than one that waits for
  the next push.

  Approval is not a skip, and the flag is no longer usable as a silent bypass:
  `--allow-breaking` now *requires* `--changelog` and `--changelog-base`, so it
  cannot be wired up without also wiring up the thing that records what was
  approved. The detector still runs, and the job summary lists every breaking
  change being permitted next to the CHANGELOG note that justified it. The
  approval is refused if there is no `### BREAKING` section under
  `## [Unreleased]`, or if that section is byte-identical to the base branch's —
  checked in both directions, because "a BREAKING section exists" alone would
  let the first note in a release cycle excuse every later break in that cycle.

  The version-bump half of the old promise was dropped rather than implemented:
  this repository accumulates under `[Unreleased]` and bumps `VERSION` at
  release-cut, so a per-PR version check would demand something no PR can
  correctly do. The comment now says what the control does.

  Thirteen new tests, all of which fail against the pre-change tree. Four are
  wiring assertions over the workflow YAML itself — that some step passes
  `--allow-breaking`, that the step passing it is guarded by the label and
  presents its evidence, that the unapproved path still blocks, and that
  `labeled` is in the trigger types. A unit-tested function with no caller is
  indistinguishable from a working feature until something asserts the call.

- **`screencast.yml` could never get past its third step.** Its
  `cache-dependency-path` named `apps/web/pnpm-lock.yaml`, which does not
  exist — this is a pnpm workspace with one lockfile at the root — and
  `setup-node` hard-fails when the cache path matches nothing. Every other
  workflow in the repo already pointed at the root lockfile; being
  `workflow_dispatch`-only meant no scheduled run ever exercised it.

- **Four more known-red CI entries, and the reason each could sit on `main`.**
  None was anyone's recent breakage; all four reproduced on a pristine
  checkout. What they had in common is more useful than what broke: in every
  case the thing that should have objected either did not run, was not
  required, or could not fail.

  - **`Backup → destroy → restore` had lost its object store for the second
    time.** `minio/minio` was withdrawn from Docker Hub (the repository 404s),
    the job was moved to the quay.io mirror pinned by digest, and quay.io now
    answers **401 UNAUTHORIZED for every tag and for that digest** — the whole
    repository, not one tag. A third MinIO coordinate would be the same bet a
    third time, so the fixture is now Versity's Apache-2.0 S3 gateway
    (`ghcr.io/versity/versitygw`, pinned to the v1.8.0 multi-arch index
    digest). It is a real S3 server rather than a mock, so `backup.sh` and
    `restore.sh` still drive `aws s3 cp/ls/rm` and `s3api head-object` for
    real; and it is on GHCR, which this workflow's own images already use and
    which cannot be withdrawn independently of the CI it runs on. The job also
    gained a readiness probe: `docker run -d` succeeding only means the
    container was created, and the previous shape would have spent the bucket
    loop's retries before failing with a connection error that said nothing
    about why.
  - **`docker compose up — full stack` failed building `services/realtime`,
    and not for the reason it looked like.** The lock and the manifest do
    agree (`npm install --package-lock-only` is a no-op against the committed
    lock), the Dockerfile does copy `package-lock.json` into both stages, and
    Node 22 is consistent across the Dockerfile, CI and `@types/node`. The
    failure was `esbuild`: a transitive of `tsx` that the image never runs,
    whose install script hardlinks the platform binary into place and then
    immediately execs it to read its version, with no retry — under BuildKit
    that exec loses a race with the writer still holding the inode and fails
    `ETXTBSY`. The builder stage now installs with `--ignore-scripts`, which
    it can do because the only thing it needs from devDependencies is `tsc`.
    The emitted `dist/` is byte-identical. The runtime stage deliberately
    keeps its install scripts: what it installs is what ships.
  - **`test_business_context_hotpath.py` reached a real database.**
    `FusedAlertTriageWorker.triage()` opens asyncpg connections through
    `business_context._load_tenant_rules` and `ledger.persist_auto_triage`, so
    with an inherited `DATABASE_URL` two tests failed with `InterfaceError:
    cannot perform operation: another operation is in progress` — pytest-asyncio
    gives each test its own event loop, and the module-level pool one test
    opens is unusable by the next. The agents unit suite now declares that it
    runs with no database, in `tests/conftest.py`, and **enforces it**: the
    inherited DSN is removed and a real asyncpg connection raises. The guard
    is a `BaseException` on purpose — every call site it covers is wrapped in
    a fail-soft `except Exception`, which is correct in production and is
    exactly why the bug was invisible, so an `Exception` here would be
    swallowed by the handlers it exists to police. Two tests that drive the
    real client against a DSN they set themselves are marked
    `touches_database`. Replaces two earlier workarounds that did not work:
    `os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "")` is a no-op precisely when the
    variable is set.
  - **`test_a_missing_handler_is_not_retried` asserted nothing that could
    fail.** It named `RUN_AV_SCAN` as its missing handler; that stopped being
    true when the response verbs were wired into `_HANDLERS` via
    `RESPONSE_STEP_TYPES`, so the step took the *retry* branch and was
    attempted four times over fourteen seconds — the behaviour the test's own
    docstring forbids — while reporting green. Its one behavioural assertion,
    `_elapsed_ms == 0`, could not notice: `t0` resets at the top of every
    attempt, so the field is the duration of the final attempt alone, and it
    reads 0 both when the engine skips the retry loop (which writes a literal
    `0`) and when a handler fails in under half a millisecond. The test now
    takes its step type from the registry instead of naming one, so it cannot
    silently rot the same way again, and asserts the property directly by
    recording backoff sleeps. The file went from 14.13s to 0.16s. The
    `patch_handlers` fixture now saves originals with `setdefault`, so a
    second install of one key cannot write a test double permanently into the
    process-wide handler registry.

  Why `main` carried them: `backup-restore` and `docker compose up — full
  stack` fail hard but are **not** among the nine required checks, and compose
  smoke is pull-by-default — it only builds a service when that service's
  build context changed, so it is usually green without building the thing
  that was broken. `test_business_context_hotpath.py` runs inside `Python —
  Tests`, which **is** required, and passed only because GitHub's runners have
  nothing on 5432 and the agents step sets no `DATABASE_URL` — green by
  property of the runner, not of the code. `test_playbook_engine_correctness.py`
  was named by no workflow at all; it is one of **62 of the 82** test files
  under `services/agents/tests` in that position. The playbook and per-tenant
  business-context files are added to the agents test list (gated agents tests
  529, up from 303); the remaining gap is real and is not closed here.

- **Four tests failed on a clean checkout and belonged to nobody.** A suite
  with known-failing tests teaches everyone to skim past red, so each is now
  either fixed or skipped with a reason that says what to do about it.

  - `test_hunt_scheduler_cron.py::TestNextFireAt::test_basic_hourly` asserted
    croniter's answer (the top of the next hour) from a class that, unlike its
    neighbour, carried no `_CRONITER_AVAILABLE` guard — so without the
    dependency it failed rather than skipped. Not environmental: the fallback
    is an interval stepper with defined behaviour that nothing was checking.
    It now asserts the right answer on each path, so both are tested.
  - `test_router_report.py::test_findings_with_html_tags_are_escaped` required
    the literal `&lt;script&gt;`, which only the `markdown` branch produces —
    the `<pre>` fallback escapes the already-escaped body again and emits
    `&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;`. That is more escaped, not less, so a correct
    branch was reporting a security failure. It now asserts the property that
    matters (nothing reaches the document as an executable tag, and the
    payload is still present rather than dropped) on either branch.
  - `test_router_report.py::test_html_wraps_markdown_with_document_chrome`
    genuinely needs `markdown` — a declared dependency of the service — and
    now skips with that stated, while CI installs it and runs the file, which
    it had never done.
  - `test_graph_freshness.py::test_graph_writer_does_not_block_fusion_on_failure`
    treated "something answered on port 8080" as "the ingest service
    answered". Its only escape hatch was a connection error, so an unrelated
    local service returning 401 became a failure reading "fusion should never
    block on graph". It now checks `GET /health` reports `service: ingest`
    before asserting anything, and the skip names what did answer.

- **The same commit did not build the same way twice, and one of the ways it
  could build did not start.** `One real event through the real pipeline`
  failed and then passed on re-run with no code change. The API container had
  died at import with `AssertionError: Status code 204 must not have a
  response body` from `app/api/v1/endpoints/community.py:183` — a file
  byte-identical to `main`, on a branch that touched nothing under
  `services/api`.

  Measured, from the failed run's own log: `poetry install` hit a transient
  error, the Dockerfile's pip fallback took over, and it pinned
  `fastapi>=0.111,<0.112` and installed 0.111.1. In the same build `fusion`'s
  poetry install succeeded and took 0.141.1. One commit, two resolvers, two
  answers.

  `community.py` has `from __future__ import annotations`, so its `-> None`
  return annotation reaches FastAPI as the string `"None"`. FastAPI resolves
  it through `ForwardRef` to `NoneType` — truthy — rather than the falsy
  `None` singleton it gets without PEP 563, concludes the route returns a
  body, and asserts that a 204 does not. **Every release from 0.111.0 through
  0.116.2 raises; 0.117.0 and later do not.** The declared range was
  `>=0.111,<0.142`, so 29 of the 120 releases it permitted could not import
  the service at all, and the fallback pinned squarely inside that band. The
  earlier triage read the shape as innocent because it was checked without
  PEP 563 active, which is the one condition that makes it fail.

  The fix is determinism rather than a widened assertion:

  - **All thirteen Python services install from a committed `poetry.lock`.**
    Three had one; ten now do. Two `--no-cache` builds of one commit produce
    an identical `pip freeze` (129 packages, same SHA-256), and a new
    `Reproducible builds / twice` job asserts it on every change.
  - **The pip fallbacks are gone** from all eight Dockerfiles that had one.
    Each carried its own copy of the dependency list under a comment asking
    for lockstep, and each had drifted. A build that fails is recoverable; an
    image that boots on versions nothing tested is not.
  - **Four services that hand-listed their dependencies in the Dockerfile**
    (`honeytokens`, `purple-team`, `ueba`, `mesh`) now install from a lock
    too. All four had drifted from the manifest they mirrored — `mesh` shipped
    `cryptography<50` against a manifest reading `<51`.
  - **The FastAPI floor is 0.117** in all thirteen manifests and every
    workflow. `services/api/tests/test_fastapi_floor.py` pins the boundary and
    fails on 0.116.2 with the original error; a matrix leg imports the service
    at both ends of the declared range.

- **`Event spine (real containers)` had a genuine race, not a flaky
  environment.** The graph-writer assertion was
  `docker compose logs … 2>/dev/null | grep -q "<early string>"` inside a step
  running under `set -euo pipefail`. `grep -q` exits the instant it matches —
  and that string is line 4 of the service's output — which closes the pipe
  while Compose is still writing; Compose exits 255 on the broken pipe and
  `pipefail` promotes that over grep's 0. The pipeline reported failure over a
  line that was present, which the failing run proves: the log dump its own
  error handler printed 115 ms later contains the exact string.

  Reproduced deterministically rather than inferred — with a large log the
  pipeline returns 255 every time, with a small one that fits the pipe buffer
  it returns 0 every time, and the match is in both. That size dependence is
  why it read as a flake. `2>/dev/null` made it worse by discarding the only
  message that distinguished "Compose failed" from "the line is absent", so
  the run reported the wrong cause. Fixed by capturing the logs once and
  grepping the capture, and by checking Compose's own exit status separately —
  not by a retry or a longer sleep, which would have converted a real race
  into a slower real race. `scripts/doctor.sh` has the same shape twice and is
  unaffected: it does not set `pipefail`.

- **Two more gates were exempt from the empty-corpus rule only by accident.**
  `check_route_auth.py` and `check_tenant_query_predicates.py` did not exit 0
  over an empty tree, but neither had a corpus floor: each happened to fail
  first on its own stale-exemption ratchet, because every entry stopped
  matching at once. That is a true statement about the wrong thing, and it
  disappears the moment somebody empties the table. Both now refuse the
  corpus itself, ahead of every output mode including `--inventory`, which CI
  runs as its own step — a green step printing `TOTAL 0` is the same defect
  one level out. The route gates share one floor, in
  `check_route_tenant_scope.py`, because they share one collector; the
  predicate gate refuses each of the three ways its scan can empty
  separately, since files, tenant-scoped tables and statements reaching zero
  are three different losses and the middle one is the quiet one. Proven both
  ways: with every exemption table emptied the floor is still what refuses,
  and the real repository is unaffected.

  `check_route_auth.py` now imports its scanner as a module rather than by
  name. It took `REPO_ROOT` and `SERVICES_DIR` by value at import time, so the
  shared self-test rebinding them would have left this gate scanning the real
  checkout while believing it was pointed at an empty one — a self-test that
  proves nothing, which is the shape the whole exercise is about.

- **`check_gate_contract.py` can now ask "the directory exists and is empty",
  not only "the repository is not there".** Its scratch tree omitted
  `services/` and `detections/` entirely, so a gate opening with
  `if not X.is_dir(): return 2` refused it for a reason that says nothing
  about its corpus — and the way a corpus is actually lost is a renamed
  package or a glob that stopped matching, neither of which removes the
  directory. A second **skeleton** shape creates them empty and every check is
  probed against both. The cost was measured rather than assumed before
  committing to it: 64 of the 71 checks already refused the skeleton, and of
  the five that did not, three were defects now fixed and two were already
  recorded exceptions. The exception table is keyed by shape and has five
  entries. Probe runtime went from ~8 s to ~16 s.

- **`check_route_tenant_scope.py` reported OK having scanned zero routes.** It
  refused a tree with no `services/` directory, which is not how a scan loses
  its corpus: a renamed package, a changed decorator spelling or a walk that
  stops descending all leave the directory in place. Against a `services/`
  tree with no routes in it the gate printed `scanned 0 routes across 0 files`
  and then `OK: every route taking a tenant identifier authenticates` — the
  same sentence CI shows on a real pass. It now exits 2, and `--self-test`
  carries the case. Naming the count was only half the fix: the number was
  already printed, directly above the clean verdict.

- **The dependency audit reported success over a tree with no manifests.**
  `security_audit.py`'s pnpm, python and go arms each discovered zero targets
  and printed `0 findings`, which is the sentence a clean audit of twenty
  services prints. The file already treated an unscanned service as a failure
  rather than a warning — the gap was that a corpus of zero was never
  *unscanned*, just empty. All three now record a coverage gap when discovery
  finds nothing, and `validate-ignores` refuses a missing policy file instead
  of reporting `Validated 0 ignore entries` and exiting 0. `get_repo_root()`
  also stopped falling back to `Path.cwd()`, which meant a run from anywhere
  else audited whatever manifests happened to be under it.

- **The dependency audit only ever looked at one of the repository's two pnpm
  install roots.** `run_pnpm_audit` ran `pnpm audit` in the repo root and
  nowhere else, so `apps/mobile` — a deliberately separate install root, with
  its own `pnpm-workspace.yaml` so its installs stop rewriting the root lock —
  was never scanned. Two high-severity advisories stood open there while the
  `security-audit` job reported a clean workspace, which is the same shape as
  the stale `poetry.lock` that once dropped `services/slack-bot` and hid eleven
  advisories. Install roots are now discovered from the tree (every directory
  holding a `pnpm-lock.yaml`), each is audited, and a finding names the root it
  came from rather than a generic "pnpm workspace". A tree with no lockfile
  anywhere is recorded as a coverage gap instead of reported as clean.

  The two advisories it surfaced (`GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq`, `GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr`
  in `image-size`) are suppressed with an expiry rather than fixed, because no
  fix is reachable: `apps/mobile` resolves `image-size 1.2.1` solely through
  `metro 0.83.3`, no patched 1.x exists, every metro release through 0.87.1
  still requires `^1.0.2`, and `image-size` 2.x drops the callable default
  export `metro/src/Assets.js` calls — so an override would break asset
  resolution at bundle time rather than bump a version. Dependabot's updater
  reaches the same verdict independently (`security_update_not_possible`).
  Both are denial-of-service only and build-time, reachable only from an image
  already committed to this repository.

- **Twenty-two dead paths in comments and docstrings**, found by the new
  gate on its first run. Among them: cost provenance pointing at migration
  `055` when the file is `063`; the Wazuh severity table pointing at
  `apps/docs/connectors/` instead of `apps/docs/docs/connectors/`; eight
  copies of the vendored `tenant_scope.py` pointing at a
  `check_vendored_tenant_scope.py` that is spelled `sync_`; eleven files
  pointing at a root-level `tests/test_security_defaults.py` that lives
  under `services/api/`; and three separate pointers at CI checks that had
  never been written, one of which `check_action_contract.py` already
  documented as fictional in its own docstring.

- **`main` went red because an install list depended on an extra it never
  declared, and an upstream release stopped supplying it by accident.** The
  `Python — Service unit tests (fusion, honeytokens, purple-team)` job failed
  on `purple-team`'s `test_every_api_route_requires_auth` with
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'greenlet'` — 99 other tests in the
  job passed. Nothing about `purple-team` had changed: the test has imported
  `app.api.routes` since it was written, that module has always imported
  `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio`, its `pyproject.toml` has always declared
  `sqlalchemy[asyncio]`, and its `poetry.lock` resolves `greenlet 3.5.6`. The
  declaration was right and the install path was wrong: this job consults
  neither the manifest nor the lock, it pip-installs a hand-curated list, and
  that list named a bare, unbounded `sqlalchemy`.

  It passed for months anyway. Through SQLAlchemy 2.0.x, `greenlet` was
  required *outside* the `asyncio` extra whenever `platform_machine` matched
  one of `aarch64 | ppc64le | x86_64 | amd64 | AMD64 | win32 | WIN32` — true
  on `ubuntu-latest` — so a bare `sqlalchemy` installed it incidentally and
  the extra was load-bearing and unnamed at the same time. SQLAlchemy 2.1.0
  removed that clause, leaving `greenlet>=1; extra == "asyncio"` as the only
  requirement. 2.1.0 was published at 20:12:49 UTC on 2026-09-24; the last
  green commit on `main` (`ba0c6429`) is timestamped eleven minutes before it
  and the first red one (`ad775e8d`, #829) ten minutes after. #829 was an
  LLM-routing change that touched no file under `services/purple-team` and
  nothing in that import chain — it is the commit whose run happened to
  re-resolve first, not the cause. So this was neither a dependency that went
  missing nor an import path newly reached; it was an unpinned install
  re-resolving across an upstream minor.

  The job now installs `"sqlalchemy[asyncio]>=2,<3"`, matching both the
  manifest and the wave-2 matrix job, which had it right all along.
  `greenlet` is deliberately *not* added as a top-level pin: the extra exists
  to pull it, and naming the transitive package instead would record the
  workaround rather than the dependency. `isolation.yml`, which had done
  exactly that — bare `sqlalchemy` plus an explicit `greenlet` — now declares
  the extra and drops the compensating entry.

- **The wave-1 service-test job installed twelve packages with no version
  bound, which is the outage that already happened, still loaded.** A CI job
  pip-installing a hand-curated list named a bare, unbounded `sqlalchemy` and
  passed for months only because a platform marker happened to pull
  `greenlet`; when 2.1.0 deleted that clause, every import of
  `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio` began failing at collection. That one was bounded.
  The other twelve in the same list were not, and the job's own comment said
  so — *"Bounding the range is the second half: unbounded, any upstream
  release lands here before anyone reads it."* `pydantic`,
  `pydantic-settings`, `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `structlog`, `redis`,
  `aioredis`, `httpx`, `aiokafka`, `asyncpg`, `clickhouse-driver` and `pyyaml`
  now carry the range the three services under test declare, so the job
  installs what they ship rather than whatever PyPI is serving this morning.

  Two things fell out of doing it, both pre-existing and both invisible while
  the install was unbounded. `redis` was installed bare while
  `services/fusion` declares `redis[hiredis]` — the same dropped-extra shape
  as the `sqlalchemy` break, an install path quietly installing a smaller set
  than ships. And the three manifests **could not be satisfied at once**:
  `services/fusion` declared `httpx = "^0.26.0"` while `honeytokens` and
  `purple-team` declare `>=0.27.0`. The unbounded install resolved 0.28.1, so
  fusion was being tested on a version its own manifest forbade and shipping
  0.26.0 — tested and shipped were different software, which is the exact
  thing `check_dependency_pins.py` exists to prevent. fusion moves to
  `>=0.27,<0.29`, matching api / actions / mesh / osquery-tls / slack-bot /
  teams-bot, and its lock re-resolves to 0.28.1 so the three now agree and the
  job tests what fusion ships. All three suites pass on the bounded set
  (fusion 308, honeytokens 66, purple-team 100, every coverage floor met).

  Still unbounded and reported rather than silently fixed: `services/connectors`
  and `services/threatintel` also declare `httpx = "^0.26.0"`, and neither is
  in this job.

- **`services/connectors` reached `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio` without declaring
  the extra that makes it importable.** `app/db/engine.py` calls
  `create_async_engine`, and the manifest declared `sqlalchemy = "^2.0.0"`.
  It resolved only because of the same pre-2.1.0 accident, which means the
  next SQLAlchemy bump would have dropped `greenlet` from the lock the image
  installs from and broken the poller in production rather than in CI. It was
  the only service in this position — every other service that imports the
  module already declared `[asyncio]`. Re-locking with the extra changes two
  lines and no resolved version.

- **`scripts/check_dependency_pins.py` now compares extras, not just
  version ranges.** `sqlalchemy` and `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` are two different
  dependency sets, and the gate that exists to assert every install path
  agrees was reading the name and the range and discarding the extras — so it
  reported agreement between a manifest and a workflow installing strictly
  less software. Extras are now part of a declaration's identity in both
  syntaxes (PEP 621 brackets and Poetry's `extras = [...]` table, the latter
  being the one that was silently dropped), with three directions checked
  because the direction nobody aims a gate at is the one that rots:
  `manifest -> install path` (a workflow or image dropping an extra a
  manifest declares), `source -> manifest` (code importing the module an
  extra enables under a manifest that does not declare it, read out of the
  source so the manifest is not asked to vouch for itself), and
  `extra -> lock` (an extra declared while the lock resolved nothing it
  provides — "the extra is declared and the library is absent" is now a
  sentence this gate can say). Run against the pre-fix tree it names all
  three defects above and the files holding them; `--self-test` injects each
  direction separately, and six tests in
  `tests/test_dependency_pin_gate.py` pin the parsing and the directions.

- **`scripts/check_toolchain_pins.py` compares every Node install root
  against every other.** There are four — the workspace root, `apps/mobile`,
  `services/realtime` and `services/mcp/cursor-extension` — and the gate read
  dependency resolution out of the first one only, so the `image-size` split
  above was invisible to it. It now discovers install roots structurally,
  reads both pnpm and npm override spellings and both lockfile formats, and
  checks in both directions: an override declared in one root against what
  every other root resolved, and each root's own lockfile against its own
  manifest. Exemptions are keyed on the exact versions they were verified
  against, so a bump re-opens the question rather than inheriting the
  clearance. Running it against the pre-fix tree names the defect and the
  file; running it over a lockfile it cannot parse, or a tree with no
  install root, fails rather than reporting a clean comparison it never
  performed. The gate found a third instance of the same class on first run
  (`ws` 6.2.6/7.5.13 in `apps/mobile`, verified clean against OSV and
  recorded).

- **CI installed `cryptography>=41,<46` for services whose manifests required
  `>=46,<51`** — two ranges with no overlap, so the version CI tested could
  never be the version the image shipped. `connectors` and `osquery-tls` also
  floored at `44.0.1` for CVE-2024-12797 while CI was free to install `41`.
  One range, `>=46,<51`, now covers every manifest, Dockerfile and workflow,
  including `packages/aisoc-cli`, whose Ed25519 plugin signatures the API
  verifies. `PyJWT` was unbounded in eight workflow install paths and is now
  `>=2.8,<3` everywhere; `poetry` itself was 1.7.1 in five images, 1.8.2 in
  three and unpinned in two workflows, and is now `2.4.1` everywhere.

- **`ruff` was declared six different ways while `ruff format --check` gated
  on one of them.** `services/api` permitted `<0.17.0`, `fusion` `^0.2.0`,
  the published packages `>=0.3`, and the devcontainer installed it unpinned —
  while CI enforces `>=0.4.4,<0.5`. A contributor installing their own service's
  dev group got a ruff that reformats the tree and reds their PR with no
  dependency change in the diff. All fourteen declarations now read
  `>=0.4.4,<0.5`. The devcontainer also told contributors to `uv sync` against
  `services/api/uv.lock`, which has never existed in this tree.

- The workspace-wide `esbuild` override ban now applies to every install
  root instead of the repository root alone. `apps/mobile` was the one place
  the mistake that broke Turbopack's font import map could have been
  reintroduced without anything noticing, because its bundler is Metro and
  the damage would surface in a different workspace.

- **Dependabot proposed Expo SDK 57 packages for an SDK 54 app, from an entry
  that was never meant to see them.** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` excludes
  `apps/mobile` with a `!apps/mobile` negation and pnpm honours it — the root
  lockfile has no `apps/mobile` importer. Dependabot's manifest scan does
  not: it expands `apps/*`, finds `apps/mobile/package.json` and proposes
  updates for it from the root `/` entry, where none of the Expo holds
  written into the dedicated `/apps/mobile` entry apply. The result was
  `expo-constants 18.0.14 -> 57.0.19` — a release-train version, not a
  package version — carrying no lockfile change at all, since from the root
  entry's point of view the lockfile is the root one and the package is not
  in it. `pnpm install` resolves it to `expo-router 6.0.24 unmet peer
  expo-constants@^18.0.13`, while `tsc --noEmit` stays green, so the mobile
  job would have passed. Fixed with `exclude-paths: ["apps/mobile/**"]` on
  the root entry, which is version-updates-only and so leaves that
  directory's security alerts with the entry that owns them.

- **The root entry's holds are written per dependency name, so a breaking
  major of anything not already on the list still arrives as an ordinary
  weekly bump.** `vitest` 4.1.11 → 5.0.1 was the demonstration. Every
  `ignore` in that entry names a specific package someone had already been
  burned by — `eslint`, `typescript`, `storybook`, `@storybook/*` — and
  nothing holds majors as a class, so "stop proposing breaking majors"
  described four names rather than a rule. Measured on the proposal: all 59
  test files and all 615 tests passed, then the run failed with 59 unhandled
  rejections reading `TypeError: Expected string coverage payload, received
  object` from `V8CoverageProvider.onAfterSuiteRun`, and a coverage report of
  `All files | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0`. vitest 5 changed the V8 coverage payload
  shape and `@vitest/coverage-v8` stayed on 4.1.10, because its own manifest
  range was still satisfied and it peer-requires `vitest` at an *exact*
  version rather than a range. Separately, the root `pnpm.overrides` pins
  `@vitest/mocker` to `>=4.1.11 <5` while `vitest@5.0.1` depends on
  `@vitest/mocker@5.0.1`, so the override wins silently and the proposal's
  lockfile carries a vitest 5 runtime with a vitest 4 mocker. Held at the
  major for `vitest` and `@vitest/*`, and grouped within the major so the
  exact-version peer pair stops drifting — `pnpm install` on the current
  lockfile already reports `unmet peer @vitest/coverage-v8@4.1.11: found
  4.1.10`, which is survivable inside a major and is why nobody had noticed.

- **`update-types: ["version-update:semver-major"]` cannot hold a 0.x
  dependency, so the Storybook hold covered every member of the family
  except the one that needed it.** For a pre-1.0 package the breaking change
  arrives in the minor slot, and `@storybook/test-runner` is the only
  pre-1.0 member: 0.23.0 declares
  `peerDependencies: { storybook: "^0.0.0-0 || ^8.2.0 || ^9.0.0" }` and
  0.24.5 declares `"^0.0.0-0 || ^10.0.0 || … || ^11.0.0-0"`. Its version line
  is independent of Storybook's the way the Expo packages' are, but its peer
  tracks the Storybook major exactly, so 0.24 is the Storybook 10 line of
  the package and installs against this workspace's `storybook@9.1.20` as an
  unsatisfied peer. Nothing in CI could catch it — no workflow runs
  `test-storybook`, and the only Storybook job runs `build-storybook`, which
  never loads the runner — so the proposal was green on all 22 required
  checks while migrating the whole jest tree 29 → 30 underneath it. The
  minor channel is now held for that package alongside the family's major.

- **The `services/realtime` Dependabot entry let the eslint family arrive one
  package at a time.** `@eslint/js@10.0.1` declares
  `peerDependencies: { eslint: "^10.0.0" }`, so bumping it alone against this
  service's `eslint@^9` installs a tree `npm ls` reports as `invalid` in nine
  places — and nothing else notices: `npm ci`, `tsc`, `eslint src test` and
  the test run are all green on it, and the effective rule set grows by three
  rules rather than shrinking. Unlike the root workspace this service does
  not use `eslint-plugin-react`, and `typescript-eslint@8.70.1` already
  accepts `eslint@^10`, so the family is grouped rather than held: it can
  move whenever all of it arrives in one reviewable pull request.

- **The `services/api` pip entry had no holds, against two ratchet gates.**
  `ruff` is declared in fourteen files (a count
  `scripts/check_dependency_pins.py` enforces agreement across) and `mypy` in
  six, plus `.github/workflows/ci.yml` for both, and Dependabot can only edit
  one of them.
  Measured rather than assumed: `ruff` 0.16.8 reformats 90 files and reports
  3 lint errors where the pinned 0.4.10 reports `All checks passed!` and
  `1229 files already formatted`; `mypy` 2.3.1 makes
  `scripts/check_mypy_baseline.py` exit 1 with 35 `(tree, file, code)`
  entries no longer matching. Both failures land on the required
  `Python — Lint & Type-check` check, which is to say on every open pull
  request rather than on the bump's own. Held at the majors (and, for `ruff`,
  the minors, since 0.4 → 0.16 is a minor step under semver while 0.4.x
  patches still flow). `sqlglot` is deliberately *not* held: an `ignore` rule
  suppresses security updates as well as version updates, and a single-path
  sqlglot bump already cannot merge because `scripts/check_sqlglot_pin.py`
  fails closed when the seven install paths disagree.

- `.github/dependabot.yml`'s `apps/mobile` entry gains the `typescript`
  semver-major hold that the `/` and `/services/realtime` entries already
  carry. Its CI gate is `tsc --noEmit`, so it was the only Node install root
  running `tsc` without the hold — the same shape as the `image-size`
  finding, a decision taken for the workspace that never reached the root
  installing separately.

- **`_SECRET_PATTERNS` was declared with a type its value cannot have, which
  switched off checking of the secret-masking loop.** The annotation in the AI
  SDK's redaction module read
  `tuple[tuple[str, re.Pattern[str]], None | str] | tuple`, whose first member
  is a two-element tuple — structurally impossible for the eight-pair value, so
  it only ever matched through the bare `| tuple`. That erases the element type
  to `Any`, which is why nothing objected to calling `.subn` on something typed
  as possibly a `str`. In a path whose job is to stop secrets leaving the
  process, a checker that has been silently switched off is worse than none.
  Declared `tuple[tuple[str, re.Pattern[str]], ...]`, which is what it is.

- **Five LLM input-contract handlers raised `TypeError` instead of degrading.**
  `/translation`, `/phishing`, `/knowledge-base`, `/hunts` and `/detection-loop`
  each catch `LLMContractViolation` — the untrusted-input boundary refusing a
  prompt — and logged it as `logger.warning("<event>", reason=exc.reason)`.
  `logger` is `logging.getLogger`, not structlog, and the stdlib `Logger`
  rejects an unknown keyword with a `TypeError`. An exception raised inside an
  `except` block is not caught by a sibling handler, so the `except Exception`
  sitting directly beneath it never saw it: the one path whose job is to
  degrade gracefully was the only path that raised. `phishing.py` carries a
  comment explaining that the log line was added *because* the handler used to
  swallow everything — the fix for the silent failure was itself throwing. Only
  six of thirteen trees declare `[tool.mypy]`, so an AST scan swept the rest of
  `services/` and `packages/`; those five were the only instances repo-wide.

- **Six guards inspected a different call's result from the one they
  guarded.** `x.get(k) if isinstance(x.get(k), dict) else {}` calls `get`
  twice; it is safe for a plain dict and that is not a property anything
  enforces, which is what the twenty `union-attr` findings underneath it were
  reporting. Fetched once and then tested, in `playbook_step_dispatch`,
  `siem_writeback` and `sla`.

  Together with a `_compute_durations` return annotation that claimed
  `dict[str, int | None]` while returning a `str` severity, these take the mypy
  ratchet from 690 to 656. `packages/sdk-py` declared `[tool.mypy]` with no
  `python_version`, so it was type-checked against whichever interpreter the
  job ran and its share of the baseline moved with CI rather than with the
  code; it is pinned to 3.11 like the other five, and the toolchain gate now
  fails on a tree that asks to be type-checked without saying against which
  Python. What remains on the ratchet is annotation hygiene and artefacts of
  the deliberate no-dependencies environment the baseline is recorded in — the
  19 surviving `union-attr` are all `mock.call_args` in tests.

- **A cancelled context-graph walk crashed the context bundle.**
  `_fetch_neighborhoods` and `_fetch_ueba_baselines` filter
  `asyncio.gather(..., return_exceptions=True)` results with
  `isinstance(r, Exception)`, then unpack the survivors as a tuple.
  `asyncio.CancelledError` is a `BaseException` and not an `Exception` on 3.8+,
  so a cancelled child task passed the filter and reached the unpack as
  `TypeError: cannot unpack non-sequence CancelledError`. `services/slack-bot`
  carries a comment spelling out this exact trap; these two sites got it wrong.
  Both now filter on `BaseException`.

- **A Google Workspace key that was valid JSON but not an object failed inside
  the JWT signing path.** `json.loads` returns a `str`, `list` or `int` for a
  document that is valid JSON and not an object, and the constructor accepted
  it; the failure surfaced later as `TypeError: string indices must be integers`
  at `self._key["client_email"]`, at the moment an operator triggered a live
  action. The configuration is wrong either way — it now says so when the
  credential is saved rather than when it is used.

- **`DEFAULT_SLA_TARGETS` was declared twice with disagreeing bodies, and
  neither matched the migration.** The second definition won by being later in
  the file and put `info` at `(480, 1440, 2880)`; the first said
  `(240, 960, 2880)`; migration 040 seeds `(240, 1440, 4320)`. A tenant's
  info-tier deadline therefore depended on whether it had a seeded row
  (240 min) or fell back to Python (480 min) — and `alert_queue` reads exactly
  this row as the `sla_due_at` catch-all for severities outside the four-tier
  ladder. One definition now, matching the migration, which is what is in the
  database.

- **`diff_fingerprints` was declared to return `dict[str, list[str]]` and never
  has.** It returns `unchanged_count` as an `int`, which the connector
  scheduler stores and a test asserts on. Because the scheduler assigns the
  result straight into a `dict[str, Any]` variable, the wrong declaration
  narrowed that variable and made the three correct lines underneath it look
  like type errors instead — one wrong annotation producing four findings across
  two modules. Declared `dict[str, Any]`, which is what both consumers and the
  JSONB column already expect.

- **`posture_loader` returned `None` from a function declared to return a
  dict** when a 200 response carried no `config` key, while the non-200 branch
  immediately above already returned `{}` for the same "nothing to load"
  outcome.

- **A load generator that could tick forever and send nothing.**
  `services/demo-producer` silently `continue`d when `http.NewRequestWithContext`
  failed, which only happens for a malformed URL — the one error in that
  loop no retry can clear. It now says so and stops.

### Removed

- **The identity timeline's phantom second source.** It queried a table named
  `aisoc_events` that no migration creates, nothing writes to, and that appears
  nowhere else in the repository — with its failure swallowed at `DEBUG`. It
  read as a second source of evidence while returning nothing on every
  deployment. The remaining source now reports itself on the response
  (`sources_unavailable`) when it cannot be read, so an empty timeline caused
  by a broken query is distinguishable from one caused by no matches.

- **The Chronicle warehouse scaffold.** It read `hunt.translated_query["udm"]`,
  nothing in the repository emits UDM, and it gated on two settings that were
  never fields — so it could not be selected and could not run, while
  `available_providers()` reported it as a supported warehouse. Adding a real
  one is a `register_provider` call plus a UDM translator.

### Security

- **Fifty-eight routes across four services carried no authentication at all,
  and the previous gate could not see them.** `check_route_tenant_scope.py`
  asks a conditional question — *if* a route takes a tenant, where did the
  tenant come from — so a route that takes no tenant was never in its reach.
  37 `services/agents` routes took none. Reproduced against the real routers
  with credential material configured, so the result is not "the service was
  unconfigured": an anonymous caller with no `Authorization` header created a
  playbook (201), listed all 64 (200), **executed one** (202) and deleted it
  (204), then read copilot conversations and ran a threat hunt. All seven
  refuse with 401 now, while a valid console session still gets a non-empty
  response.

  `services/agents` keeps **dual-mode** auth rather than a bearer-only
  scheme, because the console reaches it directly through a Next rewrite on a
  session cookie: the guard is #813's `require_console_or_service_auth`,
  extended rather than replaced. Its WebSocket could not use the same
  dependency — a browser cannot set an `Authorization` header on a handshake,
  and an `HTTPException` has no defined rendering on a WebSocket scope — so
  `_ws_principal` reads the credential from the header or `?token=`, verifies
  it with the *same* vendored logic, and closes with 1008 before `accept()`.
  That route previously took its tenant from a query parameter defaulting to
  the literal `"default"`, which names no tenant anywhere in this schema, and
  would start a fresh investigation on the connection.

  Also closed: `connectors` (9 data routes, including the one that decrypts a
  saved instance's credentials to test them and the two that push into a
  customer's ITSM), `fusion` (5), `osquery-tls` (7), `threatintel` (1),
  `actions` (1) and 20 in `services/api` — among them `PUT /deployment/config`,
  `POST /deployment/airgap/bundle`, `POST /compliance/evidence/collect`, both
  LLM-backed `/translate` routes and the seven STIX/TAXII routes.

  Two counts in the original report were **wrong, in the safe direction**, and
  the reason matters: `slack-bot` (5) and `teams-bot` (4) were never open. An
  AST pass sees no `Depends` and calls a route unauthenticated, but Slack Bolt
  verifies a request signature, `/approval-card` compares a shared internal
  token in constant time, and the Teams webhook verifies an HMAC-signed card
  payload with a replay window. `scripts/check_route_auth.py` models these as
  **conditional** exemptions that name the verifier and lapse the moment the
  handler stops calling it.

- **Thirty routes across six services let the caller name the tenant they were
  reading.** `/fusion/entity-risk/*` was the reported instance and the worst
  one: three routes on the API gateway and three on the fusion service took
  `tenant_id` as a query parameter with no auth dependency at all. The console
  reaches fusion *directly* through a Next rewrite when `FUSION_URL` is set, so
  those routes were reachable from any browser on the internet, and an
  anonymous request naming another tenant's UUID returned that tenant's
  entity-risk queue, stats and per-entity detail. The engine's own docstring
  asserted the missing control — "the tenant_id is part of the key prefix and
  the API service re-checks tenant on read" — and the second half was not true
  on either side. Key prefixing isolates whichever tenant it is handed;
  validating the parameter's *value* fixes nothing, because a UUID that parses
  is still a UUID the caller chose.

  An AST pass over all 600 routes in `services/` found the same shape in five
  more places, in two flavours. Taking a tenant with no authentication:
  `services/agents` `/triage/{run_id}`, `/cases/{id}/triage`,
  `/cases/{id}/investigate`, `/investigations` and `/explain`; and six
  `services/osquery-tls` routes. Taking one *with* authentication but never
  intersecting it with the caller's scope: `honeytokens`, `purple-team` and
  `ueba`, where a router-level service token proved the caller was a trusted
  service but said nothing about which tenant it was acting for.

  The tenant now comes from the credential. A new
  `app/security/tenant_scope.py`, vendored into the six services that need it,
  resolves either a console session (the first-party HS256 access token, whose
  verified `tenant_id` claim is authoritative) or a trusted service declaring
  the tenant it acts for on `X-AiSOC-Tenant-ID`. A `tenant_id` on the request
  survives only as a *filter*, intersected with that scope, so an MSSP
  operator can still narrow to one managed customer while naming an outside
  tenant narrows to nothing and returns 403. A service token that declares no
  tenant resolves to an empty scope and is refused: absent is never all, which
  is the shape every cross-tenant leak in this codebase has had. The HS256
  verification is stdlib-only and mirrors `services/realtime/src/auth.ts`,
  rejecting `alg: none`, a refresh token presented for access, and an expired
  or wrongly-signed token.

  Closing these surfaced a worse variant the parameter audit could not see:
  eight routes matched on an id with **no tenant predicate at all**.
  `honeytokens` `GET/PATCH/DELETE /{token_id}` and `/{token_id}/triggers`,
  `purple-team` `PATCH /executions/{id}/detection` and the three
  `/tabletop/{session_id}` routes, and `ueba`
  `PATCH /anomalies/{id}/acknowledge`. Any caller could read, revoke or delete
  another tenant's honeytoken, overwrite another tenant's detection outcome,
  or acknowledge away another tenant's anomaly by naming its UUID. All eight
  now filter on the caller's tenant as well as the id, so a foreign row is a
  404 — which is what it is, from that caller's point of view.

- **Any authenticated user could disable detection rules inside any other
  tenant.** `_ensure_mssp_parent`, the guard on the MSSP write surface, had
  `pass` for a body. Four routes took a caller-supplied child tenant id and
  wrote it onto a row without checking whose child it was.

  The consequential one was `POST /api/v1/mssp/overrides`. An override with
  `action: "exclude"` is read back by `resolve_effective_rules`, filtered on
  `child_tenant_id == <the reader's tenant>`, and the rule is popped out of the
  set `POST /api/v1/rules/hunt` runs. So naming another tenant's id silently
  deleted a named detection from their hunts, and the victim's only symptom was
  a hunt that stopped matching. Reproduced against the previous commit: a
  tenant's effective ruleset went from one critical cloud rule to zero on an
  override written by an unrelated tenant.

  Closing those four routes alone would not have been enough, because
  `POST /api/v1/mssp/children/{id}/onboard` let anyone *become* the parent
  first — its only check was a `409` when the target already had a parent, so
  every standalone tenant on a deployment was adoptable by any authenticated
  user. Adoption now requires the child to have invited that specific parent by
  setting `settings.mssp_parent_invite` through `PATCH /api/v1/tenants/me/settings`,
  which only ever writes the caller's own row and is gated on `settings:write`.
  The invite is single-use. The child-scoped routes answer `404` rather than
  `403` for a tenant that is not yours, so they cannot enumerate tenant UUIDs.

- **`/api/v1/identity-timeline` read every tenant's alerts.** Both routes bound
  an authenticated user and never used it: the SQL against `aisoc_alerts`
  carried no `tenant_id` predicate, so any authenticated caller could pull any
  tenant's alerts whose title or evidence matched a substring — and the
  substring is the search term, so the match is caller-controlled. Both routes
  are now scoped to the caller's tenant.

- **`/api/v1/playbooks` had no authentication at all.** The module declared no
  `Depends` of any kind across eight routes and there is no global auth
  middleware, so every route was reachable unauthenticated — including
  `POST /playbooks/{id}/run`, which executes a playbook against the estate.
  Each route now demands `playbooks:read`, `playbooks:write` or
  `playbooks:execute`; all three permissions already existed in
  `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` and had no reader. `:execute` stays distinct from
  `:write` so an analyst can run a governed playbook without editing one.

- **`scripts/check_tenant_query_predicates.py` — the predicate question.**
  Closing the parameter shape surfaced eight routes matching on an id with no
  tenant predicate; the sweep that found them was opportunistic. This gate
  asks the question structurally over the whole tree, and the model and table
  inventories are **derived from the tree** (a model's `tenant_id` column, the
  migrations' DDL) rather than listed, so a new migration cannot slip past.
  It matters most where nothing stands behind it: of 95 tenant-scoped tables
  only 31 carry an RLS policy, and RLS engages only on a session that ran
  `SET LOCAL app.current_tenant_id`.

  Real leaks it found beyond the known eight:

  - `GET /graph/attack-path/{case_id}`'s **relational fallback** read
    `aisoc_cases` by id with no tenant predicate. The primary Neo4j path is
    scoped, but the fallback runs precisely when that path failed — and its
    own docstring says it exists so deployments without a graph database keep
    working, i.e. permanently for many of them. An authenticated caller naming
    another tenant's case UUID got its title, severity, MITRE techniques and
    alert ids.
  - `GET /osquery/distributed/{query_id}` was **both** unauthenticated and
    unscoped. `osquery_distributed_query` has no `tenant_id` of its own — it
    is reached through its node — so the lookup now joins onto
    `osquery_node.tenant_id`. Demonstrated with two seeded tenants: before,
    tenant B naming tenant A's `query_id` got A's host telemetry back; after,
    nothing.
  - `alert_explain._resolve_rule_lineage` selected a detection rule by an id
    lifted out of the alert's `raw_event` — vendor-supplied, so a crafted
    event could name another tenant's rule and have its definition explained
    back.
  - The ITSM webhook inserted its system comment into `aisoc_case_comments`
    **without `tenant_id` at all**, leaving rows belonging to no tenant since
    migration 044 added the column.
  - Thirteen by-id writes (`alerts` escalate/snooze/update, four `connectors`,
    three detection-rule routes, `claim_alert`, `run_saved_hunt`) were scoped
    only by a preceding read. Not exploitable as written, and one reorder from
    being scoped by nothing.

  What cannot be decided statically sits on a **shrink-only ratchet** — 34
  entries, each with a reason, `MAX_RATCHET` asserted against the table's
  length, and an entry whose statement is now scoped failing as *stale*. That
  last property caught two of this change's own edits.

- **Row-level security covered 31 of 95 tenant-scoped tables; it now covers 92,
  and the seven policies that already existed but could never work are
  repaired.** On the other 64 tables the query predicate was the only thing
  between two customers, so one missing `WHERE tenant_id` was a leak rather
  than something a second layer caught — which is not the design the
  repository documents. `060_rls_coverage.sql` adds a policy to every
  remaining table in the API chain, and the four services that manage their
  own schema (honeytokens, osquery-tls, purple-team, ueba) each carry a
  matching alembic revision. The three that remain are named rather than
  rounded away: `users` is excluded so authentication can resolve a principal
  before a tenant exists, and `case_tasks` / `case_timeline` are ORM models
  that no migration creates.

  Four things found along the way, each invisible for the same reason:

  - **The application bypasses RLS entirely.** `docker-compose.yml` and the CI
    service containers run every service as `POSTGRES_USER=aisoc`, which the
    postgres image creates as a superuser, and a superuser ignores policies
    even under `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Measured, not inferred: with two
    alerts seeded one per tenant and the session bound to tenant A, that role
    sees both and a `NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS` role sees one. The security doc
    claimed the opposite — "there is no superuser escape hatch via the
    application's DB role" — and now carries the grant that makes it true.
  - **Seven policies were keyed on a session variable nothing sets.**
    `alert_sla_events` and `tenant_sla_config` read `app.tenant_id`;
    `custom_parsers` and `retention_policies` read `app.current_tenant`;
    `compliance_evidence` had no unset-context arm. All five returned zero
    rows once RLS engaged. `external_assets` and `external_asset_drift` called
    `current_setting` without `missing_ok`, so an unbound session raised
    `unrecognized configuration parameter` instead. All seven are normalised
    to the canonical predicate.
  - **The agents service had the mirror-image bug.** Its four
    `_set_rls_context` helpers wrote `app.tenant_id` while every policy reads
    `app.current_tenant_id`, so the scoping they exist to provide had never
    been applied — the policies fell through their fail-open arm every time.
  - **Five tables had RLS enabled without `FORCE`**, so the table owner —
    which is the application — walked past the policy regardless.

  `tests/isolation/test_postgres_rls.py` is the evidence, wired into
  `integration.yml`'s migrations job where a real database with the full chain
  already exists. It seeds an A row and a B row into every RLS-covered tenant
  table (80 of 80 in the API chain), asserts both are visible unscoped before
  asserting either absence, then binds the session to A and asserts B's row is
  unreachable. It also asserts the shipped role's bypass, so a green run here
  can never be read as "tenant isolation is on in production".

- **The attack-path relational fallback is verified against a real Postgres.**
  `GET /graph/attack-path/{case_id}` reads `aisoc_cases` by id whenever the
  Neo4j traversal fails — which for a deployment shipping no graph database is
  always. It gained a tenant predicate in the previous release, but that fix
  was covered by a gate and by review only: the statement uses
  `CAST(:cid AS UUID)`, which SQLite mangles, so no offline suite could execute
  it. Tenant B naming tenant A's case UUID is now demonstrated to be refused
  against the database the query is written for, with tenant A's row asserted
  present first.

- The case-timeline linked-alert hydration in `cases.py` now binds a tenant as
  defence in depth. Reaching it already required a tenant-scoped case, so this
  was not a live read, but a poisoned `alert_ids` array would otherwise have
  surfaced another tenant's alert title.

- **`services/osquery-tls` enrolled every node under the literal `"default"`,
  which resolves to no tenant on any seeded deployment.** The service keys
  `tenant_id` as a `String(64)` while the platform keys UUIDs, and nothing
  translated. Migration `001` seeds the canonical tenant with slug `default`,
  but the demo seed renames that slug to `demo`, so the literal matched
  neither the UUID nor the slug and silently matched nothing: FIM events were
  written under a string the console could never ask for, and the FIM surface
  returned an empty table that looked like "no file changes" rather than "the
  read and the write disagree". `app/services/tenant_resolver.py` now resolves
  the placeholder to the canonical seed tenant by its **stable UUID** —
  ignoring whatever the slug has been renamed to — falling back to the sole
  tenant of a single-tenant install, and refusing enrolment for a genuinely
  unknown ref rather than filing the node under an unreadable tenancy. Skips
  log at `warning` with the ref; a silent `debug` skip is how the original bug
  survived.

- **The maintainers' hosted origin shipped in the default CORS allow-list of
  nine services.** `services/{api,agents,connectors,honeytokens,purple-team,ueba}`
  (six byte-identical copies of the shared `cors.py`), `services/realtime`, and
  the Go `ingest` and `enrichment` servers all listed `https://tryaisoc.com` and
  `https://www.tryaisoc.com` among the origins they trust when
  `AISOC_CORS_ORIGINS` is unset. That is one deployment's public origin baked
  into every self-hosted install, trusted for credentialed cross-origin
  requests its operator never opted into — and if that domain ever changed
  hands, the grant travels with it. The default is now local development only;
  the hosted deployment already sets `CORS_ORIGINS` explicitly
  (`infra/fly/api/fly.toml`), so nothing legitimate depended on the default.
  `apps/docs/docs/deployment/env-vars.md` documented the old list and was
  corrected with it, and a new gate pins the six vendored `cors.py` copies
  byte-identical — nothing enforced that before, and a single drifted copy is
  exactly how one service would quietly keep the origin.

- **The seeded demo identity was a live, operator-owned domain.**
  `demo@tryaisoc.com`, paired with a published password, appeared across
  compose, fly, render, coolify, railway, two workflows, the web Dockerfile and
  the docs. It told a self-hoster to type somebody else's hostname to sign in
  to their own install, and published a well-known credential pair against a
  real domain. Now `demo@example.com` — RFC 2606 reserved, so it can never be
  registered and can never receive mail, and it still satisfies the
  `pydantic.EmailStr` check that rejected the earlier `demo@aisoc.local`. Every
  config and doc moved with it. Safe to re-run: `seed_demo._ensure_user`
  reconciles on `DEMO_USER_ID`, not on the address, and rewrites a stale email
  in place.

- **`scripts/check_route_auth.py` — default-deny over all 601 routes.** Every
  route must carry an auth dependency or appear in one of three tables, each
  recording why it is public. It reuses the tenant-scope gate's AST collector
  rather than adding a second parser: building it surfaced that
  `playbooks.py`'s `ExecuteUser = Annotated[AuthUser, Depends(require_permission(...))]`
  was reported as an unauthenticated playbook-run, because the vocabulary
  listed `ReadUser` and `WriteUser` and nobody thought of the third. Auth
  aliases are now resolved by **what they wrap**, which removes the naming
  dependency in both directions — the reflex fix of appending the new name to
  the list is how a list stops describing anything. State after: 517
  authenticated, 73 public with a recorded reason, 11 verified in-band, 0
  unexplained.

- **`approval_timers` is in a migration and carries a policy.**
  `services/slack-bot`'s `PostgresTimerStore` created it at startup with
  `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, outside every chain in the repository — so
  `060_rls_coverage.sql` never saw it, it had no `tenant_id` for a policy to
  filter on, and it decides whether a pending containment auto-rejects. Under
  the DML-only runtime role the DDL itself fails, because Postgres checks the
  schema ACL before the existence test, and `main.py` caught that into a
  warning and fell back to the non-durable store: durable approval timers
  would have quietly stopped being durable. `062_approval_timers.sql` adds the
  table, a `tenant_id`, and the canonical policy; the store probes with
  `to_regclass` and refuses with the migration's name rather than creating
  anything, carries the tenant in every statement, and binds
  `app.current_tenant_id` on each pooled connection so the policy engages too.
  A deployment already carrying the runtime-created table converges on the
  same shape, with its existing rows defaulting to an empty `tenant_id` that
  the migration says how to backfill.

- **The zero-CodeQL-alert invariant was documented for four months with
  nothing enforcing it.** `apps/docs/docs/operations/security.md` has said
  since 2026-05-15 that "the Python alert count on `main` is zero, and we
  treat that as a CI gate — a new alert breaks the security workflow". No such
  gate existed anywhere in the repository. `codeql.yml` uploads SARIF and
  `github/codeql-action/analyze` does not fail a build on findings; `main` has
  no branch protection, so "Code scanning results" was not a required check
  either; `security.yml`'s only hard job is the claim-to-gate matrix; and
  nothing in the tree queried the code-scanning API. The scan itself was
  healthy — `main` was analysed continuously, most recently minutes before
  this was written — so the usual stale-green and mixed-`codeql-action`-pin
  traps were both ruled out. The enforcement was simply imaginary, which is
  why two `note`-severity alerts could sit open on `main` under a documented
  count of zero.

  `scripts/check_codeql_alerts.py` is that gate, wired into the new
  `.github/workflows/codeql-alert-gate.yml` on push to `main`, on pull
  requests, on a `workflow_run` after CodeQL finishes, and daily. It fails on
  any open CodeQL alert at **any** severity — `note` included, since both
  motivating alerts were `note` and carried no `security_severity_level`, so a
  threshold anywhere would have reproduced the original silence exactly. It
  also refuses the vacuous pass: an unanalysed ref, a declared language with
  no analysis, an analysis older than ten days, or one belonging to a
  different commit than the one that triggered the run are all failures rather
  than a clean bill of health, and an input it cannot read exits 2 rather than
  0. Dismissed alerts stay excluded — that is GitHub's audited escape hatch
  and the repository uses it for ~20 accepted-risk
  `py/request-without-cert-validation` findings — but the count is printed on
  every run so a silent mass-dismissal is visible. `--self-test` injects an
  alert at each severity plus every shape of vacuous pass and requires the
  gate to catch all ten; CI runs it immediately before the gate itself.

- **`scripts/validate_playbooks.py` printed to stderr and called `sys.exit(2)`
  while being imported** (CodeQL `py/print-during-import`, alert #896). Beyond
  the note, this was a live defect:
  `scripts/check_playbook_schema_parity.py` imports the module to read
  `SUPPORTED_TRIGGERS` and wraps the import in `except Exception`, which
  cannot catch `SystemExit` — a broken environment would have killed the
  parity gate's interpreter instead of producing its diagnostic. The import
  now raises `ImportError`, which that handler catches.

- **`python-jose` is gone, and `ecdsa` with it.** `ecdsa` carried
  CVE-2024-23342 (Minerva timing attack on P-256) with no patched release —
  OSV records the affected range as introduced at 0 with no fixed event,
  because upstream states python-ecdsa offers no side-channel resistance and
  will not fix it. It was an unconditional requirement of `python-jose`, so
  the suppression was renewed rather than resolved. `services/api` now signs
  and verifies with `PyJWT`, which it already depended on for the OIDC and
  SAML paths; `python-jose`, `ecdsa` and `rsa` all leave the dependency tree.
  Six CI workflows installed `python-jose[cryptography]` and never installed
  `PyJWT`, and reached `cryptography` — a declared direct dependency of
  `services/api` — only through that extra; they now install both by name.

- **`image-size` moved to a patched release instead of staying suppressed.**
  Both advisories were held open on the reading that no fix existed. They
  record a vulnerable range of `<= 2.0.2`, and npm has published 2.0.3 and
  2.0.4; a null `first_patched_version` is not the same claim as no fix
  existing. A pnpm override pins `>=2.0.4 <3`, which
  `@docusaurus/mdx-loader`'s `^2.0.2` range accepts. This clears the only two
  high-severity advisories in the pnpm workspace.

- **`apps/mobile` resolved a vulnerable `image-size` that the workspace had
  already fixed.** Two high-severity advisories — GHSA-5p2g-fcmc-qvqq
  (CVE-2025-71329, JXL/HEIF parsers) and GHSA-w3rx-r6r6-pgpr
  (CVE-2025-71330, ICNS parser), both infinite-loop denial of service, both
  fixed in 2.0.3 — stayed open against `apps/mobile/pnpm-lock.yaml` for a
  structural reason rather than an unfixed one. The repository root pinned
  `image-size` to `>=2.0.4 <3` through a pnpm override, and `apps/mobile` is
  a deliberately independent install root with its own
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and lockfile, created that way so its install would
  stop rewriting the root lock. The override could not reach it and nothing
  compared the two. Resolved by declaring the same override in
  `apps/mobile/package.json`; the lockfile now resolves `image-size@2.0.4`
  and drops its `queue` dependency with it.

  Metro is the only consumer, and no version of Metro that depends on
  `image-size` permits 2.x — every one declares `^1.0.2`, which is why
  Dependabot recorded `security_update_not_possible` and failed its job
  instead of opening a pull request. Metro 0.83.3's two call sites go
  through `_interopRequireDefault(require("image-size")).default`, and
  `image-size@2.0.4`'s CommonJS build still exports a callable `default`, so
  `metro.getAssetSize` returns correct dimensions against it.

- **The dependency suppression list is empty.** All 42 entries in
  `scripts/security_audit_ignores.txt` were re-verified against OSV and
  against the versions the lockfiles actually resolve. Every one was
  resolvable, and most of the justifications had stopped being true: nine
  starlette entries blamed a `fastapi<0.137` cap that exists in neither bot
  service, three cryptography entries blamed `<50`/`<49` caps that exist
  nowhere in the repository, and the langchain, weasyprint, anyio, aiohttp,
  h2, idna and pydantic-settings entries each named a version older than the
  one their lock resolves. The file now records what was measured, so the next
  review starts from evidence rather than from the previous reason string.

- **The pnpm and Go arms of the audit could report success without scanning.**
  A failed `govulncheck`, an unparseable `pnpm audit` response and a registry
  that never answered were all recorded as warnings, which exit 0 — so the job
  printed "0 findings" for ecosystems it had not read. All three now record a
  coverage gap, which `exit_code_for` already failed on for the Python arm.
  That property — an unscanned target fails the build — had no test; it does
  now.

## [9.0.0] — 2026-09-23

**Ten waves, and one finding under nearly all of them: the mechanism existed,
was tested, and nothing called it.** v8.0 named that shape and found it a
dozen times. This release went looking for it deliberately, across the whole
tree, and found it again in the approval loop, the marketplace, the mobile
console, the detection engine and the benchmark scoreboard. A passing unit
test on an uncalled function is indistinguishable from a working feature
until somebody traces the call graph, and the only defence is to trace it.

The one worth stating first, because it inverts what the feature appeared to
do: **approving an action executed nothing.** `decide()` flipped a row,
notified the realtime service and returned 200 without ever touching
`services/actions`. Every tap of Approve in the responder app recorded a
decision and ran nothing — while telling the operator the opposite. That is
the most dangerous shape a security control can have, because what it appears
to say is "the host is contained". And the other end was missing too: nothing
in the repository ever created an approval, so the queue had no producer
either and was structurally empty on every deployment.

### Added

- **Approvals reach a human and then reach the estate** ([#731](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/731),
  [#735](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/735)). The triage worker raises
  one approval per proposed action that declares `requires_approval`, keyed
  deterministically so a Kafka replay re-raises the same approval rather than
  a second copy an operator cannot tell apart. `decide` carries the decision
  through to `services/actions` and records on the row whether it executed, in
  four distinct states, so "was this actually done" is answerable from the row
  rather than by correlating two services' logs. A refusal returns 502 saying
  the decision was stored and the action was not run.
- **The confidence × impact approval matrix now runs.** `approval_matrix.evaluate`
  was written, documented, unit-tested and listed in the claim-to-gate matrix
  as GATED, with **zero production callers** — `POST /actions` gated on blast
  radius alone, a property of the verb, so the same answer came back for a
  40%-confidence guess and a corroborated finding. Both gates run and the
  stricter wins, which is the composition rule the matrix already stated, so
  nothing can auto-execute that did not before. Ten action types tighten, and
  `/actions` becomes tier-aware for the first time.
- **A browser-facing proxy for the live-action registry.** Every route sat
  behind a service token, so nothing could answer "what can AiSOC do to my
  estate". Discovery and dry-run only: a live containment goes through the
  approval path so an approver is bound to it.
- **`apps/mobile`, a native responder app** ([#733](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/733)).
  The roadmap said the mobile console was "not started", which was true about
  React Native and misleading about the product — the responder console
  already existed as a PWA with a service worker, an offline approval queue
  and Web Push. The native app is a distribution channel, and it exists for
  one reason: iOS Web Push requires an installed PWA and has been unreliable
  even then. Unit tests and type-check run in CI; **no device build,
  simulator run or store submission has been performed**, and a CI gate fails
  if the README stops saying so.
- **`@aisoc/sdk` gained the namespaces a responder client needs** — approvals,
  push, on-call, live actions. All were in `docs/openapi.yaml` the whole time,
  which is why the gap went unnoticed: the generated types were complete and
  the hand-written surface was three releases behind.
- **Marketplace publisher identity, paid listings and entitlements**
  ([#734](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/734)). Migration `056`. There
  is no payment processor and no stub of one — wiring payments is an account
  action. What exists is the enforcement point, which is the part that would
  otherwise be written last and least carefully.
- **An egress default-deny NetworkPolicy** ([#736](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/736)),
  gated by `helm.yml`. Off by default, because a cluster whose CNI does not
  enforce NetworkPolicy ignores it silently and a control that is silently
  ignored reads as protection while providing none.
- **Distinct counting in the windowed detection engine**
  ([#737](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/737)). "Fifty reads by one
  principal" is a script retrying; "fifty *different* secrets read by one
  principal" is a vault being walked. Counting events cannot tell those apart,
  and 21 of the 74 rules awaiting a windowed evaluator name a `distinct_*`
  field.
- **`docs/audit/DEFERRED_SUBPHASES.md`** ([#739](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/739)).
  Six lettered sub-phases were "tracked in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`", which is
  gitignored and was never committed — so six named commitments had no scope
  anywhere a contributor could read.
- **New gates:** `helm.yml` (lint, render, kubeconform, server dry-run against
  a real kind cluster), `mobile.yml`, `check_go_module_paths.py`,
  `check_published_packages.py`, and scoreboard staleness.

### Fixed

- **UEBA never scored a single message** ([#730](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/730)).
  It consumed `security.events`, which nothing in the platform writes — ingest
  writes `aisoc.raw_events`. So `ueba.anomalies` never carried a message and
  fusion's UEBA confidence boost, on by default and fully built, could only
  ever be inert. `feature_extraction.py` recovers the entity and features from
  the OCSF envelope.
- **The ingest inbox could not have worked on any deployment.** Routes mount
  only with `DATABASE_DSN`, which no compose file set, and the templates were
  never copied into the runtime image, so even a correctly-configured
  deployment answered 503 for every template. Templates are `go:embed`-ed now:
  a directory cannot be missing from an image.
- **CrowdStrike alerts were anonymous.** The connector never read
  `behaviors[].user_name`, and the canonical field map knew only `actor` while
  11 of the 68 canonical-envelope connectors spell it `username` or `user`.
  Since the correlation key is `{tenant}:{entity}:{tactic}`, they all
  correlated as `unknown`. The alias list is a slice, not more map entries,
  because Go randomises map iteration and three entries pointing at one
  destination would resolve differently per process.
- **An approved action was not the action approved.** `approve_action` rebuilt
  `ActionRequest` without `parameters` or `principal`, so an action gated
  *because of what it targets* ran against defaults and reported COMPLETED —
  and the submit path never stored parameters at all, so no rebuild could have
  recovered them.
- **Pending actions lived in a module-global dict.** A restart lost every
  action awaiting approval and a second replica could not see the first one's,
  so an analyst taps Approve on a Slack card and gets "Action not found" for
  an incident that is still live. Migration `055`.
- **Neither ChatOps bot could send an unsolicited message.** Replies go through
  Bolt's `respond()`, which writes to a `response_url` that only exists inside
  an inbound interaction, so the bot could answer a question and not ask one —
  while `rich_approval_card_blocks` sat fully written with no production
  caller and the Approve/Deny handlers sat wired and waiting.
- **A plugin could never be rejected for a bad signature.**
  `_get_registered_pub_key` returned `None` unconditionally, so `publish_plugin`
  skipped verification entirely. The signing path existed end to end, had a
  CLI command, and was incapable of saying no.
- **No registry allow-list and no digest pinning**, both of which the notes
  claimed existed. There was a deny list of three metadata hostnames, and
  nothing resolved a tag to a digest — so `:latest` stayed mutable and "what
  is this deployment running" had no answer after the fact. The signature gate
  does not close that: it verifies whatever arrived.
- **`aisoc plugin publish` POSTed to a route no router has ever served.**
  Broken as shipped.
- **The public scoreboard was frozen for ten weeks and every check passed**
  ([#738](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/738)). "Freshness" meant the
  accuracy value was current and nothing read the row's date; the newest row
  was taken by file position rather than by date; `--refresh` rewrote only the
  accuracy, so a refreshed row described today's code and claimed to have been
  measured in July. And there was no writer at all — `live-agent-eval.yml` had
  `contents: read`.
- **Neither published Go SDK was installable.** Both declared
  `github.com/beenuar/aisoc/<name>` — wrong case against a case-sensitive VCS
  path, missing the `packages/` prefix. Every in-repo consumer used a `replace`
  directive, which is the shape that hides this: the tree builds perfectly and
  the artifact does not exist.
- **The Helm chart did not render.** `helm template` fails outright until
  dependencies are fetched, and no documentation said to fetch them — nor to
  `helm repo add bitnami` first, which a clean machine also needs.
- **OpenSearch was recorded as dead code and is not.** The check had been made
  against `services/api`, which holds no OpenSearch client, and never against
  `services/threatintel`, which indexes into it in its lifespan with no flag
  and no `try`. Two real defects were hiding under the wrong verdict: compose
  set an env var that service discards, so the connection worked by
  coincidence, and it declared no dependency on OpenSearch so it raced it at
  boot.
- **One connectivity check at boot is a coin toss.** The graph writer verified
  Neo4j once and a failure disabled it for the process lifetime; compose
  cannot express "depend on neo4j only in the `full` profile", so ingest lost
  a race it had no way to wait for. The integration gate caught it
  intermittently — the same branch passed at 21:06 and failed at 21:19.
- Two stale comments that described working code as broken: the reachability
  gate's claim that the windowed engine "has three hardcoded rules and no
  loader", and the windowed exporter's claim to mirror the stateless one
  "exactly: specs are the source of truth".

### Changed

- **Packaging stops moving the number.** It slipped v8.0 → v8.1 → v8.2 for the
  same reason each time. The README now states a fact rather than a date —
  the pipeline builds and packs all eight packages on every tag, and the
  upload is blocked on registry credentials, which is an account action.
  `check_published_packages.py` reads actual registry state so that claim
  cannot go stale in either direction once credentials exist.
- Vulnerability-match events are opt-in: every stock deployment was
  downloading the CISA KEV catalogue at boot to publish into a topic with no
  reader.
- `aisoc.alerts.raw` is reclassified from dead to external entrypoint. No
  in-repo producer is what an entrypoint *is*.

### Known

- **Eight of the nine `PARTIAL` claim-to-gate rows remain**, each still naming
  its own gap. The air-gap row narrowed rather than flipping: the Helm half is
  built and gated, platform-wide egress-blocked CI is not. Relabelling a row
  for the half that is done is what that file exists to prevent.
- Whether migrations 050–056 apply to an *existing* Postgres volume is still
  untraced. Compose mounts them as `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, which runs
  only on a fresh volume.
- 133 detection rules remain unreachable. Authoring a `wd-*` rule does not make
  a `det-*` rule reachable, so `MAX_UNREACHABLE` is unchanged on purpose.
- The OCI install route is held back. Adding it made CodeQL flag eight
  `py/path-injection` sites across the plugin-ingest graph; trading "a hardened
  path with no caller" for "a reachable path with eight unresolved high
  findings" is the worse position.

## [8.1.1] — 2026-09-23

**The v8.1.0 notes described a platform its own quick start never started.**
This release contains no new capability. It exists because an adoption audit
of the repository — installability, architecture comprehension, data
provenance, pipeline connectivity — found that the single most-followed path
into AiSOC did not run AiSOC, and that finding accounts for most of the
recurring feedback on its own.

`./install.sh` handed off to a nine-service compose file with **no ingest
service, no fusion service, and `AISOC_DISABLE_KAFKA: true`**. Everything
visible in the resulting console came from `seed_demo.py` writing fifteen
fabricated incidents straight into Postgres. A reader followed the README, saw
a populated console, and concluded the platform worked — having never run the
platform. The installer printed *"AiSOC is up and running"* because the
compose command exited 0.

The good news the audit also produced: **the core pipeline does work.** It had
simply never been demonstrated. `make smoke` now pushes one real event through
ingest, Kafka, fusion and detection and reads the alert back from the API,
reaching past nothing, and CI fails if any stage does.

### Fixed

- **The documented quick start never ran the product** ([#726](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/726)).
  `install.sh` now runs `make up` — the same CORE stack the README documents
  and CI tests — and then runs the golden pipeline, so the installer's success
  banner reports a verified event traversal rather than a process exit code.
  `infra/compose/docker-compose.demo.yml` is kept for screenshots and UI work
  and now says at the top of the file that it cannot answer whether AiSOC
  works.
- **`services/ingest` answered `/health` unconditionally** ([#727](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/727)),
  so *"ingest is healthy"* and *"every event is being dropped"* could both be
  true at once — precisely the state a broker outage produces. `/readyz` now
  dials Kafka rather than reading a cached connection flag, because kafka-go
  reconnects lazily and a cached flag is stale in exactly the situation this
  is meant to catch. Verified live: 200 with Kafka up, 503 with a reason and a
  log hint with Kafka stopped.
- **Three of the eight publishable packages could not be built** ([#725](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/725)).
  The release pipeline builds and packs every package on each tag precisely so
  it cannot rot while the upload is credential-gated — and on the v8.1.0 tag
  it earned that design back. `aisoc` and `@aisoc/mcp` failed with
  `Could not resolve "@aisoc/report-card"`: that workspace dependency's `main`
  points at a build artifact and `pnpm --filter <pkg> build` never builds
  dependencies, so the `...` suffix was missing. `aisoc-cli` could not produce
  a wheel at all — `pyproject.toml` declared `packages = ["src/aisoc_cli"]`
  *and* a `force-include` mapping the same templates directory to the same
  wheel path, so hatchling refused on the duplicate. Neither was visible
  anywhere but a tag. `test_packaging.py` now builds the wheel and looks
  inside it, because a test that read the config would have declared both
  fine.
- **Alerts were labelled `"crowdstrike crowdstrike"`** — vendor and product
  joined without deduplication, in two copies of the same helper, so fixing
  one left the other. There is one shared implementation now
  (`fusion/app/services/provenance.py::product_label`). In the same pass, an
  alert's `description` was `str(raw_data)`, so the console showed
  `{"command_line": "powershell.exe -nop ...` where a sentence belongs,
  discarding the vendor's own description.
- **Fusion defaulted its enrichment URL to `localhost:8082` — itself** — and
  swallowed the resulting failure at `DEBUG`; and fusion declared no
  `depends_on` for Postgres, so it raced the database on cold boot.
- **Five surfaces rendered fabricated data outside demo mode**: the MSSP
  overview and its managed-tenant and cross-tenant-incident lists, the
  Copilot's reply on API error, the air-gap status endpoint reporting
  unchecked conditions as satisfied, a hard-coded analyst identity in
  Settings, and the investigation timeline. All are gated behind demo mode and
  return honest empties otherwise. `seed_demo.py` refuses to run outside
  development unless `AISOC_ALLOW_SEED=1`.

### Added

- **`tests/e2e/golden_pipeline/`** — one deterministic end-to-end test that
  pushes raw telemetry into ingest and asserts each boundary independently, so
  a break names the stage rather than the suite. Wired into CI as
  `golden-pipeline.yml`, which also verifies the gate fails when the pipeline
  is broken.
- **`scripts/doctor.sh` / `make doctor`** — diagnoses Docker, Compose, disk,
  ports, configuration, Postgres, Redis, Kafka and every service, and prints
  the command to run next. It checks disk before Kafka and probes the broker
  directly, because the Docker VM filling up produced a Kafka that reported
  `healthy` while refusing every request.
- **`/livez` and `/readyz` on `services/ingest`**, matching `services/api` and
  `services/fusion`.
- **`scripts/project_stats.py --check`** — derives the connector count,
  executable detection count, compose service count and claim-to-gate totals
  from the tree and fails CI when the README disagrees.
- **`docs/audit/REPOSITORY_REALITY.md`** — every major component classified
  WORKING / PARTIAL / BROKEN / DEMO-ONLY / EXPERIMENTAL / DEAD CODE by tracing
  the implementation, not the filename. It records that OpenSearch is started
  by the `full` profile and read by nothing, rather than drawing it into a
  diagram as though it were part of the design.
- **`docs/architecture/README.md`** — rewritten around *what happens when
  AiSOC receives one security event*, with five diagrams whose every box links
  to the directory that implements it.
- **`docs/testing/CLEAN_INSTALL.md`** — the clean-machine walkthrough, from a
  real run.
- Migration `054_alert_provenance.sql` adds `is_synthetic`,
  `synthetic_source` and `synthetic_scenario` to `alerts`.

### Changed

- **CORE is the default deployment profile**: ten services, roughly 6 GB, and
  the smallest deployment that takes a real event and produces a real alert —
  not a cut-down toy. ClickHouse, Neo4j, Qdrant, OpenSearch, enrichment and
  connectors moved to `full`. Both heavy dependencies were already
  environment-gated, so nothing was weakened to do this. `make up-full` sets
  `AISOC_LAKE_WRITER_ENABLED` and `AISOC_GRAPH_ENABLED`, which the profile
  needs and did not previously set.
- **README rewritten for adoption** rather than release history: what AiSOC
  does, quick start, how to tell demo data from real data, connecting real
  sources, the data flow, project maturity per capability, and what AiSOC is
  not.
- **One command set.** `make install / up / up-full / down / restart / status
  / doctor / smoke / demo / logs / test / test-unit / test-integration /
  test-e2e / stats / clean`, consolidating the previous scattered scripts.
- The integration workflow boots the `full` profile with the lake writer and
  graph enabled, so it exercises the architecture it claims to.

## [8.1.0] — 2026-09-23

**Wave-2 features, and the gaps behind them.** Every item in the wave-2
backlog ([#362](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/362)) was audited
against the tree before any code was written, and the backlog turned out to be
wrong in both directions: two items were already built, and four had the
capability present with the path that feeds it broken. That is the same shape
v8.0 found a dozen times — the mechanism exists, is unit-tested, and has no
caller on the path that needs it — so auditing first is now the opening step
of a wave rather than an optional one.

Three of those gaps had security consequences, and one is worth stating
plainly because it inverts what the feature appeared to do: **a Slack or Teams
approval authorized nobody.** The bots verified who clicked, recorded them in
an audit event, and called the actions service with no approver, so the
permission-tier check and separation of duties were both skipped. An approval
path that does not authorize is worse than none, because it reads as a
control.

:::warning Breaking change for ChatOps approvals
`AISOC_ACTIONS_REQUIRE_APPROVER` defaults to `true`. If you use Slack or Teams
approvals you **must** populate `AISOC_CHATOPS_APPROVERS` or approvals will be
refused with a 403. Setup: `apps/docs/docs/operations/action-approvals.md`.
:::

Also in this release: the Codespaces quickstart can start Docker for the first
time, service images are published for arm64 so Apple Silicon can run
`pnpm aisoc:demo` at all, and packaging moves to v8.2 — the blocker is
registry credentials rather than code, and a release cannot schedule an
account action by writing a version number.

Claim-to-gate matrix: **108 rows — 99 GATED, 9 PARTIAL, 0 NO GATE**.

### Added

- **Securing the customer's AI estate.** AiSOC could already ingest an
  organisation's OpenAI and Anthropic *audit logs* — who minted an API key, who
  was granted owner. That is control-plane governance and says nothing about
  what the agents did once running. Of 23 capabilities leading AI-SOC products
  compete on, 22 already existed in this tree; this was the gap, and the five
  MCP detections already in the repo were sitting in `_quarantine/`,
  non-executable.
  - Two webhook templates (`ai-runtime`, `ai-finding`) and matching OCSF
    profiles, so the push and pull paths produce the same shape. The split
    between them is the design: routine agent activity is `6003` API Activity,
    category 6, which the promoter leaves in the lake to be hunted, while a
    guardrail finding is `2001` Security Finding, category 2, always promoted.
    All-2001 would flood the queue with an agent's normal operation; all-6003
    would leave a detected prompt injection silent in the lake. Both
    directions are tested.
  - `packages/aisoc-ai-sdk`, a dependency-free span emitter (enforced by CI,
    because it is imported into a customer's agent process). Prompt and
    response content is hashed by default and never transmitted unless the
    caller opts in — but *which secret shapes* were present is reported, so
    "this prompt contained an AWS key" is detectable while the key never
    leaves the process. Tool argument names are sent; values are not.
  - `ai_gateway` connector for LiteLLM / Portkey / Helicone / in-house
    proxies, covering every app behind a gateway — which matters because the
    apps most in need of visibility are the ones nobody will retrofit an SDK
    into. New `ai` connector category. 83 → 84 connectors.
  - Eight executable detections, authored as Python specs rather than YAML,
    since the YAML under `detections/` is a generated projection the engine
    never reads.
  - AiSOC's own MCP server is the first monitored AI asset. Its README claimed
    "every tool call lands in the AiSOC audit log with the calling user and the
    tool name"; it emitted nothing, and the API's audit middleware only records
    mutating methods with a valid JWT, so the ten read tools produced no audit
    row at all. It now emits to the same template a customer agent would use.
- **The agent's abstention rate and groundedness are published.** v8.0 wired
  groundedness scoring into the triage path and then discarded the score — it
  survived only inside a findings string. Migration 051 persists it, and
  `/metrics/funnel` exposes `abstention_rate`, `ungrounded_demotions`,
  `mean_groundedness` and `scored_verdicts`. A system that never abstains is
  not calibrated, it is guessing with confidence; publishing the rate inverts
  the usual incentive to report only an automation percentage.
- **The windowed detection engine has a loader.** It shipped with three
  hardcoded rules and its own docstring deferred the rest. That absence is most
  of why the quarantine has stayed at ~2,000 rules: a large share of
  quarantined Splunk imports are `| stats count ... by` aggregations, which
  cannot be expressed in the stateless matcher at all and had nowhere to go.
  Five rules to start, including the AI agent tool-denial counterpart to the
  low-severity stateless building block.
- **UEBA baselines non-human principals.** `service_account`, `ai_agent` and
  `mcp_server` were excluded by a regex on one HTTP route, while the schema
  column, the statistics and the Kafka path all accepted anything. These are
  the entities most in need of baselining: they run continuously with standing
  credentials. Doing this before v8.0's degenerate-variance fix would have been
  misleading, since a constant stream collapses the standard deviation and every
  such principal would have read as permanently normal.
- **Four capability pillars, on a credibility floor
  ([#696](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/696),
  [#697](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/697),
  [#707](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/707)).** The floor came first,
  because a published claim that is false costs more than a missing feature.
  - **Context graph.** Neo4j schema v1.1 adds identity, asset, cloud, business
    and threat depth — Employee joined to Identity, Vulnerability, Application
    criticality and data classification, CloudAccount and Secret, and the
    IOC → Malware → Campaign → ThreatActor → Technique chain. One
    tenant-scoped traversal resolves an alert into all five behind
    `GET /api/v1/graph/incident-context/{alert_id}`, feeding the agent's
    context bundle, with `POST /graph/context/import` for directory and CMDB
    data. Neo4j had no migration mechanism at all, so any schema change
    landed only on fresh installs; real runners now exist for all three
    non-Postgres stores (`services/api/app/db/{graph,lake,vector}_migrations.py`)
    and the gate checks the half that matters — that each is *called* from a
    startup path. Qdrant's vector dimension is immutable, so an
    embedding-model change is a re-embed, surfaced by `pending_rebuilds()`
    rather than silently mixing incompatible vectors.
  - **Recursive investigation.** `run_with_tools` shipped working, guarded and
    instrumented, with zero production callers. It now drives
    `services/agents/app/investigator/deep_investigation.py` over ten
    strategies, with seven typed lake-backed pivots in
    `services/api/app/services/investigation_tools.py` behind
    `POST /investigate/query` — the model picks a tool and passes typed
    arguments, it never writes SQL. `scripts/check_investigation_depth.py`
    asserts the loop still has a caller, because a narrative reads equally
    plausible whether the agent pivoted five times or once.
  - **Action contract.** Risk, reversibility, verification and approval are
    declared per *capability* rather than per vendor, since the contract
    belongs to the verb. `approval_matrix.py` implements confidence × impact
    and `scripts/check_action_contract.py` enforces it.
  - **SOC-agent benchmark.** `packages/aisoc-benchmark` ships an adapter
    protocol plus an HTTP adapter, so a third party's agent can be graded
    against the same corpus, with hallucination rate and real-vs-synthetic
    provenance labels on every row.
- **A model matrix, so an accuracy number names its backend
  ([#715](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/715)).** The weekly eval runs
  one model, so its numbers describe the agent *on whatever the pins resolved
  to* and cannot separate a property of the agent from a property of the
  backend. `scripts/run_model_matrix.py` grades the same corpus across several
  models, one variable at a time. It is deliberately a thin wrapper that sets
  the pins and re-invokes `run_evals.py` rather than a second evaluator — two
  definitions of accuracy drift apart, which is the defect the alert-reduction
  suite already demonstrated — and a test asserts it defines no scoring of its
  own. With no funded key every row reads **not measured**, never `0.000`: a
  zero is a measurement, and "we did not run this" is not.
- **Dead letters can be read back
  ([#713](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/713)).** Three DLQ
  implementations existed — a log line, a Kafka topic with no consumer, and one
  that forgets on restart — and the worker defaulted to the first. An invisible
  drop is indistinguishable from an event that never arrived, and only one of
  those is an incident. `PostgresDLQ` plus migration `053_dead_letters.sql`
  persists them and `GET /api/v1/health/dead-letters` reads them back with a
  breakdown by reason. `/health/fleet` reports connector staleness alongside.
- **SLO alerts are generated from the objectives
  ([#713](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/713)).** `slos.yaml` declared
  targets for 17 services while the alert rules used thresholds corresponding
  to no objective in the file. `scripts/generate_slo_alerts.py` derives
  burn-rate alerts from it, covering the five services that actually expose
  `/metrics` and naming the twelve that do not, so no alert can be permanently
  dead.
- **The last two fidelity corpora are obtainable
  ([#717](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/717)).** Four datasets have
  loaders; only two shipped a downloader. `ait_lds_loader.py` and
  `mitre_engenuity_loader.py` could parse their full corpora from the day they
  landed with no way to fetch either, so their only numbers came from a
  ten-line micro fixture — which proves the loader parses and says nothing
  about the classifier at scale. The asymmetry was invisible because each half
  looked complete alone and nothing compared the two sets;
  `scripts/check_fidelity_datasets.py` does, and also enforces licence
  acceptance and citation across all four. New `*_full` floors are marked
  `measured: false`, lead with UNMEASURED, and are set at the micro-fixture
  level rather than guessed higher, because a floor invented above an
  unmeasured result is a gate that gets lowered rather than investigated.
- **Operator tooling for the paths that only matter under failure
  ([#696](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/696),
  [#697](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/697)).** AES-256-GCM backup
  encryption in `scripts/backup_crypt.py` (chunk-framed with a per-chunk nonce
  and AAD binding the chunk index, so a truncated or reordered archive fails to
  decrypt rather than restoring a smaller database, plus a SHA-256 manifest);
  scheduled Neo4j, Qdrant and Redis backups via a Helm CronJob;
  `scripts/support_bundle.py`; a per-investigation cost budget; and per-tenant
  ingest token buckets in `internal/inbox/ratelimit.go` (per-replica, and
  documented as such) on the one endpoint deliberately open to the internet.

### Fixed

- **The sandbox determinism test compared a timer.** Its `VOLATILE` list named
  four fields the CLI does not emit — the real one is `elapsed_ms` — so the
  comparison included a wall-clock value and failed whenever two runs
  straddled a millisecond boundary, reporting "Something in the reasoner
  depends on salted hashing again" and sending a reader after a `hash()` call
  that was not there. Volatile fields are matched by suffix now, because names
  are the thing that drifts and the `_ms` convention is not.
- **The devcontainer cold-start gate could only ever validate the previous
  image.** It probed the published `:latest` even on a pull request, by design
  — so a Dockerfile change was unverifiable until after it shipped, which is
  how a devcontainer whose non-root user was not in the `docker` group reached
  `main`. A PR touching `.devcontainer/**` now builds from its own source and
  probes that, and the trigger includes `.devcontainer/**` at all (it fired
  only on changes to the workflow file).
- **The Codespaces quickstart could never start Docker
  ([#716](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/716)).** The README
  advertises Codespaces as "the zero-install way to drive the real stack in a
  browser"; it failed at step 1 of `pnpm aisoc:demo` and was not recoverable
  from inside the codespace. The `docker-in-docker` feature does two things,
  and only the first has a Dockerfile equivalent: it installs the binaries
  (replicated), and it supplies container *runtime* options (`--privileged`,
  `--init`, a volume at `/var/lib/docker`) plus an entrypoint that launches
  `dockerd`. Capabilities are granted at container creation and cannot be
  self-granted from an image, so baking the binaries and stopping there
  produced a container with `CapEff: 0` and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` outside the
  bounding set — `sudo` could not help, because the capability was not in the
  set to grant. `devcontainer.json` passes the runtime half now and
  `.devcontainer/start-docker.sh` is the missing entrypoint, running from
  `postStartCommand` so a stop-and-resume comes back with a working daemon.
  `apt install docker.io` also creates the `docker` group and puts nobody in
  it, so `node` could not reach the socket its own daemon creates and every
  command failed with a permission error that reads like a missing daemon.
  The cold-start gate is why this survived: it asserted the docker *CLI* was
  installed, which it is with no daemon anywhere. A third phase now starts a
  real daemon under the same flags and runs a container as the non-root user.
- **Service images were published amd64-only.** Apple Silicon is the majority
  of contributor laptops, and `pnpm aisoc:demo` — the README's headline
  "Docker + pnpm" path — could not pull a single service image there.
  Compose reported `no matching manifest for linux/arm64/v8` for every one,
  fell back to building four services from source, and the quickstart became
  a long silent build instead of a demo. The devcontainer image has been
  multi-arch all along, so the pattern existed and was simply never applied
  to the service images. This roughly doubles image-build time, which is the
  correct trade: a first run that cannot start is worse than a slower
  release.
- **The OSS screencast recorder defaulted to a commercial host.**
  `screencast.yml` recorded `https://tryaisoc.com` unless told otherwise and
  the shot list named that host in three shots, so a self-hoster running the
  workflow would record somebody else's deployment — and that hostname would
  then travel into the README caption. Both default to the local demo stack
  now, and the outro carries no URL at all, because a hostname there dates
  the cut and points viewers at an instance rather than at the project.
- **`beenuar/aisoc-action` does not exist as a repository.** Every
  `uses: beenuar/aisoc-action@v1` example in the README and the integration
  doc 404s. The reference that resolves is the monorepo subdirectory form,
  `beenuar/AiSOC/packages/aisoc-action@v8.1.0`, which is what both show now;
  `docs/operations/publishing.md` records what the short alias would actually
  require, since a Marketplace listing resolves to a repository root.
- **Config snapshots could never run, and reported themselves enabled.** The
  Go config-snapshotter called `GET {base}/v1/connectors/{id}/resource-config`;
  the connectors service serves `POST /api/v1/connectors/{id}/resource_config`.
  Four mismatches at once — method, prefix, separator, payload — and the last
  is not a typo: that endpoint requires decrypted `auth_config` in the body and
  the ingest service has no vault, so it could never have called that route at
  all. Renaming the URL would have turned a silent 404 into a silent 422.
  Silent either way, because a 404 maps to `ErrNotImplemented`, which the
  snapshotter treats as a soft skip — so an operator saw "T1.2 config snapshots
  enabled" on boot and zero `Configuration` nodes in the graph, with nothing
  connecting the two. Fixed with an instance-scoped route on the connectors
  service that resolves the saved instance and decrypts credentials the way
  `ConnectorScheduler` does at poll time, so the ingest service needs no
  secrets. Query values are escaped: an ARN containing `&` or `#` would
  otherwise truncate the URL or inject a parameter.
- **The documented "latest configuration" graph query matched zero edges.**
  `is_current`, `valid_from` and `valid_to` are declared in
  `schemas/graph-schema.yaml` and the published schema doc advertised an O(1)
  lookup via `:CONFIGURED_AS {is_current: true}`. Nothing wrote any of the
  three. The drift gate could not catch it, because it validates properties
  only on edges declared `event_edge: true` and this one is structural. All
  three are written now, with the limitation stated rather than implied:
  closing the previous interval needs a read-modify-write the ingest hot path
  deliberately does not do, so `valid_to` is **absent** while the interval is
  open — an open interval is not one that closed at the epoch — and the doc
  now shows the `ORDER BY valid_from DESC` query that actually works.
- **Four effective-permissions resolvers were documented as scaffolds long
  after they were implemented.** The endpoint docstring described Azure, GCP,
  Okta and GWS as returning HTTP 501, and the `NotImplementedError` branch had
  been unreachable for as long. All five resolvers report `coverage: "full"`.
  What is still limited is the *snapshot*, not the resolver: only Okta's is
  assembled from a live connector, because the other four expect a connector
  to answer the `__posture_snapshot__` sentinel and **no connector implements
  it**, so with live mode on they return 412 rather than a fabricated
  snapshot. That was honest but unrecorded, so `coverage: full` was the only
  figure a reader saw. A new gate pins the real shape of the gap in both
  directions — a resolver registered without a snapshot source fails, and so
  does a stale entry on the allow-list once its connector starts answering the
  sentinel. The gap is allowed to exist; it is not allowed to be invisible.
- **A fabricated investigation rendered whenever no run was selected.**
  `InvestigationTimeline.tsx` called `makeDemoTimeline()` — a named analyst, a
  routable source IP, "Session suspended; email dispatched" — with no demo
  gate. `check_mock_data_gated.py` missed it because it matches `MOCK_*` /
  `DEMO_*` constant *names* and this is a function call, which is the other of
  the two ways to render invented state. Gated, and the gate now also catches
  a `set*(makeDemo*())` factory. Verified by reverting the component: the
  widened gate names the exact line.
- **A ChatOps approval authorized nobody.** The Slack and Teams bots verified
  who clicked — Slack signs every interaction payload, Teams payloads carry an
  HMAC — recorded that person in an audit event, and then called
  `approve_action(action_id)` with no body. The actions service ran
  `authorize_approver` against `None`, so the permission-tier check *and*
  separation of duties were both skipped; the clicking user appeared in the
  audit trail and was never bound to the authorization decision. An approval
  path that does not authorize is worse than none, because it reads as a
  control.
  A bot cannot supply permissions — it knows a Slack user id and has no idea
  what that person may do in AiSOC, and a bot permitted to assert its own
  permissions could grant itself anything. It now asserts identity only, and
  the actions service maps it through `AISOC_CHATOPS_APPROVERS`: operator
  configuration rather than a directory lookup, because the actions service
  owns no user table and an approval should not depend on a second service
  being reachable. Fails closed — `AISOC_ACTIONS_REQUIRE_APPROVER` defaults
  true, an unmapped user is refused rather than admitted with an empty
  permission set, and a malformed map raises rather than resolving to "no
  approvers", which looks identical to correctly having none. **Operators
  using Slack or Teams approvals must populate the map or approvals will be
  refused**; that is the intended failure.
  Approve and reject are deliberately asymmetric: a rejection causes no vendor
  effect and a timeout-driven one has no human by definition, so requiring an
  identity there would strand expired requests in `awaiting_approval` forever.
  An identity supplied on a rejection is still authorized, and the decider is
  now recorded — it never was.
  Separately, the signed email-approval link pointed at
  `/v1/actions/email-decide`, a path served by no router, so every approve and
  deny button in a rendered approval email linked to a **404** — the documented
  fallback for "Slack is unreachable" failed at the moment it was needed. The
  route exists, and the recipient is signed into the token, because a bare
  signed link is a bearer credential that approves as nobody. Docs:
  `apps/docs/docs/operations/action-approvals.md`, which states the three
  remaining limitations rather than implying they are closed.
- **One `not` rule silently discarded a tenant's entire business-context rule
  set.** Rules are parsed twice by two implementations. The console requires
  `not` to be a mapping; the triage worker iterated every aggregator as a
  list, and iterating a mapping yields its string keys — so
  `_parse_condition("field")` called `.get()` on a `str`, raised
  `AttributeError`, and the caller's catch turned that into `rules = []`. A
  single console-accepted rule therefore stopped every *other* rule that
  tenant had written, suppressions included: a rule written to suppress
  known-benign noise quietly stopped suppressing, with nothing on the console
  to say so and one `warning` in the worker log. Fixed in two places, because
  the parser bug and its blast radius are separate problems — `not` takes a
  mapping now, and a rule that fails to parse is skipped while the rest
  survive. Also closed two smaller divergences: the worker accepted any
  `route_to` string while the console validated against a fixed set, and the
  two copies of that set had nothing pinning them together.
- **The API service had no LLM input contract at all.** `services/agents` has
  had a fail-closed one since T2.3 landed there; the module this repo's own
  notes described as living at `services/api/app/services/llm_safety.py` was
  absent from the tree. Seven endpoints POSTed untrusted input straight to a
  chat-completions provider — `phishing` (a submitted email body,
  attacker-authored by definition), `translation`, `knowledge_base`, `hunts`,
  `nl_detection`, `detection_loop`, and `alert_explain` (a JSON dump of the
  alert). All validate before the request now, because a check that runs after
  it is a log line rather than a control.
  The rules are shared rather than reimplemented: they sat in `contract.py`
  next to LangChain, the cost-telemetry recorder and the response cache, none
  of which ship in the API image — which is precisely why the API could not
  run them. They now live in `contract_rules.py` with stdlib imports only,
  vendored byte-identically and gated by
  `scripts/sync_vendored_llm_contract.py --check`. Two heuristics disagreeing
  about what counts as a raw log would be worse than one.
  Two more holes closed alongside: `services/agents/app/api/explain.py`
  reached a model with raw `httpx` and never touched the contract, invisible
  to a gate that walked the AST for `.ainvoke`/`.astream` only — it proved the
  LangChain path clean and said nothing about the other way to reach a model,
  so a second gate now flags any file that both names a completions endpoint
  and issues its own POST. And the NL-query translator, one file vendored into
  both services, imported `app.llm.contract` and `app.llm.factory` — neither of
  which exists in the API process. The `ImportError` was swallowed, so
  `/nl-query` always returned the deterministic translation and **never
  reached a model**: safe by accident, and invisible.
- **The detection truth table was a gate that could certify a no-op.** It
  classified rules by file path and by the key names inside `detection:`, never
  consulting the engine — so it published **947 executable** while the engine
  loaded **825**, counted 77 imported Sigma rules that have no evaluator
  anywhere in the repo, and counted 44 native rules with no compiled spec. The
  danger was worse than a wrong number: because it keyed off `_quarantine/`
  membership, a bulk un-quarantine would have raised the published figure
  without changing what fires. Executable now means "the engine loads this id".
- **663 of 825 loaded rules matched on fields that were not visible.**
  `raw_data` carries the connector's normalized dict and connectors put the
  vendor payload one level down under `raw_event`, while the matcher does a
  flat `event.get(field)`. Fixture replay could not catch any of them, because
  fixtures are synthesized from the rule they test. The workaround in the tree
  was per-field hoisting inside individual connectors. Both engines now merge
  the payload once, with connector keys winning on collision.
  `scripts/check_detection_fields.py` ratchets the 138 rules that depend on
  fields nothing computes.
- **26 connectors were mis-attributed and mostly unpromotable.** 31 envelope
  dicts emitted `raw` instead of `raw_event`, missing the normalizer's
  `isCanonicalEnvelope` check and falling through to a fallback that borrowed
  the `splunk_enterprise` profile. That profile stamps vendor "Splunk" — so
  Okta, QRadar, Carbon Black, Netskope and 22 others reported alerts as coming
  from Splunk — and is `class_uid` 4001 with an *empty* severity map, so
  category 4 with severity 0 satisfied neither branch of `should_promote()` and
  their events could never become alerts. Replaced with a vendor-neutral
  `genericProfile`.
- **The dependency audit silently skipped a service** (#650). A failed `poetry
  export` was a warning, so `services/slack-bot` fell out of the scan while the
  job passed. A gate that quietly skips is worse than one that fails, because
  it reads as coverage that is not there. Coverage gaps now fail the job, and
  regenerating the lock surfaced eleven advisories across `idna`,
  `pydantic-settings`, `anyio`, `aiohttp` and `starlette` — nine of which were
  only visible once the scan actually ran.
- The MCP README's audit-trail claim, the quarantine README's translation
  instructions (which documented the no-op YAML path that produced the 44
  orphans), and the orphaned `detections/splunk-imports/_migrated/` directory
  of 16 files that no script, workflow or doc referenced.
- **Four documented security controls did not exist
  ([#696](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/696)).** AES-256-GCM backup
  encryption — the script gzipped and uploaded. Envelope encryption as the
  control mitigating a database dump — `EnvelopeCipher` had zero callers. One
  unbroken distributed trace — neither end of the Kafka spine emitted
  OpenTelemetry. Per-tenant retention marked GATED by a test asserting the
  purge SQL *parses* while nothing called it. Four more docs told operators to
  run `alembic downgrade` against a service with no Alembic, so the documented
  recovery path failed at the one moment it was needed. Each was corrected in
  the docs **and then implemented**, so the claim could return honestly:
  envelope encryption now carries `vault:v2:` tokens with `vault:v1:` read
  compatibility and fail-closed behaviour in both directions (the three
  vendored read-path copies *refuse* a `vault:v2:` token rather than returning
  ciphertext as plaintext); retention actually deletes; and tenant offboarding
  covers all five stores, with the Postgres table list discovered from
  `information_schema` rather than hardcoded — 14 of 72 tenant-scoped tables
  had no cascade, so deleting a tenant orphaned institutional memory and
  compliance evidence.
- **The prompt-injection guard missed every action-trigger payload
  ([#697](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/697)).** Adversarial recall was
  **0.22**, and the payloads that got through were the ones that produce a real
  isolate or disable — which turns the SOC into a denial-of-service aimed at
  its own estate. Eight new patterns take recall to **0.85** with zero false
  positives.
- **Nine capabilities declared a verification probe and three had one
  ([#697](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/697),
  [#698](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/698)).** Two probes were added
  and four declarations corrected to `false` with stated reasons, and
  "unverifiable means not autonomous" is now enforced: probes are required
  unconditionally for AUTOMATIC and for HIGH/SEVERE impact regardless of
  approval tier, and waived below MODERATE where the API response *is* the
  confirmation. `suspend_session` and `force_mfa` were demoted AUTOMATIC →
  ANALYST accordingly. Building the gate surfaced **eleven capabilities with a
  contract and no executor at all, including `unisolate_host`** — the rollback
  for the most disruptive action in the product resolved to nothing — fixed
  with a `KNOWN_ORPHANS` ratchet plus 17 new executors wired to client methods
  that already existed. Separately, `AzureEntraClient.get_user_enabled` called
  `_ensure_token()` with no argument and used the return value as a bearer
  token; the method takes a client and returns `None`, so every live call would
  have raised `TypeError` — invisible in simulation, which never constructs the
  client, and that method backs the `disable_user` probe, so a containment
  would have reported UNVERIFIED for an unrelated reason.
- **The sandbox's "deterministic" baseline moved every run
  ([#696](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/696)).** Risk scores used
  `abs(hash(str))`, with three comments calling it deterministic. CPython salts
  string hashing per process. The test runs the CLI under different
  `PYTHONHASHSEED` values, which is the only way to catch it.
- **The Helm chart could not be installed at all
  ([#696](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/696)).** Three templates
  referenced values absent from `values.yaml` — the UEBA deployment read
  `.Values.ueba.replicaCount` and there was no `ueba` key — so rendering
  failed before any cluster saw it.
- **Three shell and DR traps that only appear under failure
  ([#696](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/696)).** `pg_dump` stderr sent
  to `/dev/null` under `pipefail` handed an operator exit 1 with zero
  diagnostic; `fail() { ((ERRORS++)); … }` returns the *pre-increment* value,
  so under `set -e` the first failure killed the script before it printed why;
  and `grep -oP` made `restore --latest` impossible on macOS. `openssl enc`
  also refuses AEAD ciphers outright, which is why the AES-256-GCM path is a
  Python script on `cryptography` rather than a one-liner.
- **The one-directional gates
  ([#696](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/696),
  [#707](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/707)).** The graph-schema drift
  check compared the YAML vocabulary against Go and never the reverse, so it
  reported the schema consistent while Go declared 28 labels against the YAML's
  17; it now parses the declared Go type (`NodeLabel` vs `RelType`) instead of
  classifying by string casing, which had misread `IOC`. In the same family:
  `neq` was never a matcher operator despite eleven rules using it, so
  `approver_role_neq: "codeowner"` was read as a field literally named
  `approver_role_neq`; every one of those rules' fixtures encoded the clause
  key verbatim because `build_positive()` synthesizes fixtures *from the rule*,
  so the durable fix is in the generator rather than the 22 files that
  regenerate from it; and `test_positive_fixtures_fire_and_negatives_do_not`
  only ever replayed the positives, leaving 100+ negative fixtures unrun under
  a test whose name says otherwise. Derived fields (`is_business_hours`,
  `<a>_eq_<b>` / `<a>_neq_<b>`) took the unreachable-rule ratchet from 138 to
  **133**, now reported by family — needs windowed engine, identity enrichment,
  allowlists, invented operands — so the number is actionable rather than bare.
- **A vendor's help text broke the entire docs deploy
  ([#708](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/708)).** Lacework's field help
  contains `https://<account>.lacework.net`, and Docusaurus parses `.md` under
  MDX, so `<account>` is an unclosed JSX element — one of which fails the whole
  build. The generator escapes angle brackets now, skipping code spans, with a
  gate over every connector page, because nothing about "MDX compilation
  failed" points at a vendor help string.
- **Six duplicate connector pages, with the gate reporting 100% coverage
  throughout ([#712](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/712)).** `_slug()`
  assumed hyphenated filenames; six pages predate that convention and use
  underscores, so the coverage check saw nothing at the hyphenated path and
  generated a thinner second page beside each hand-written original. The
  sidebar is generated from the same slug, so it listed only the thin copy and
  dropped the better half of each pair out of navigation. An existing page now
  wins over the convention, and a guard fails the gate when two pages differ
  only by separator.
- **Eight dead links survived in the published docs with a link checker running
  on every PR ([#709](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/709),
  [#718](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/718),
  [#719](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/719)).** A full QA pass over
  `https://beenuar.github.io/AiSOC/` — 167 sitemap pages, 170 internal and 405
  external link targets — took the health score from 81 to 99. Seven of the
  dead links pointed at three GitHub organisations that do not exist, and the
  wrong org was baked into the *generator* `scripts/curate_detections.py`, so
  fixing the page alone would have regenerated the 404. The link job could not
  catch this class: it runs lychee with `fail: false` and
  `--accept …403,429`, and GitHub rate-limits unauthenticated crawls hard, so a
  403 from rate limiting is indistinguishable from the page existing.
  `scripts/check_repo_self_links.py` is the deterministic offline replacement.
  Two links into `docs/` (which the site does not serve) also took the whole
  deploy down, since Docusaurus treats a broken relative link as a build
  failure. Stale counts were re-read from the tree — 84 connectors, not 47;
  833 executable rules, not "800 fixture-tested".
- **A hydration mismatch from adjacent JSX children
  ([#718](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/718)).** An SVG `<title>` built
  from several adjacent children gets `<!-- -->` separators injected during
  SSR that the client does not reproduce (React error #418). Build the whole
  string as one template literal so there is exactly one text node.
- **Sixty-six Dependabot alerts down to seven**
  ([#686](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/686),
  [#691](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/691),
  [#694](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/694),
  [#701](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/701),
  [#703](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/703),
  [#705](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/705),
  [#706](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/706),
  [#710](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/710), plus routine bumps in
  [#687](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/687)–[#714](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/714)).
  The three remaining highs are unpatchable (`ecdsa`, `image-size`). Two
  recurring shapes are worth remembering. A **caret pin that excludes the fix
  makes a security update unsolvable rather than pending**: the pytest advisory
  covers `< 9.0.3` and `^7.4.0` cannot reach it, so Dependabot had no version
  to propose and the failure surfaced as a red workflow rather than an open
  alert — ten services carried four different constraints for no reason, now
  uniformly `>=9.0.3,<10.0`. And **a range that permits the fix is not a lock
  that takes it**: the agents lock held langchain 1.0.2 against a 1.3.9 fix,
  all inside the existing caps. Transitive advisories need an override with a
  major ceiling, because without `<5` `@vitest/mocker` resolved to 5.0.1 —
  taking a major version of the test runner's mocking layer as a side effect of
  a security patch is how unrelated breakage gets blamed on security work.
  `dompurify` is the one worth naming: it is the sanitiser behind rendered
  report HTML, so a version below the fix was a live XSS surface in a product
  whose job is being trusted with hostile input.
- **The Fly demo outage finally has a stated cause
  ([#698](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/698)).** The self-provisioning
  deploy ran on merge and Fly answered: *"Your account has overdue invoices."*
  Both apps were reclaimed for non-payment, and the workflow's old silent
  `exit 0` when the app was missing hid that behind weeks of green runs. The
  error message used to guess at causes and got them wrong; it now prints
  Fly's own message verbatim. This is a billing action only the account owner
  can take, not a code fix.
- **Three CodeQL findings, at the root rather than around them
  ([#700](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/700),
  [#708](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/708)).** A previous attempt
  parenthesised an implicit concatenation without removing it, and added a
  top-level import alongside an existing from-import — turning one
  `py/import-and-import-from` alert into two. Fixed properly: setup prose built
  as named strings before the list, one import style per module, and four
  `py/unnecessary-lambda` findings cleared. Generated pages verified
  byte-identical.

### Changed

- Eleven new claim-to-gate matrix rows, one per capability. 84 rows: 73 GATED,
  11 PARTIAL, 0 NO GATE. The field gate is recorded as `GATED (ratchet)` with
  its closing condition rather than as clean, because 138 rules still depend on
  computed fields and claiming otherwise would be the overstatement the matrix
  exists to prevent.
- The claim-to-gate matrix ends the wave at **102 rows: 93 GATED, 9 PARTIAL, 0
  NO GATE**, one row per capability added above, each backed by a test that
  fails against the old behaviour. The ratchet (`MAX_NO_GATE = 0`) still
  forbids a regression, and no `PARTIAL` row was relabelled without building
  the gate it names — relabelling would make the file a liability instead of a
  control.
- Of the twelve hardening phases, **Phase 4 is now the only one unchecked, and
  deliberately so**: what remains is a funded provider key for the live-agent
  eval, not code. Marking it done would be the exact failure the program exists
  to prevent.
- The wave-2 work adds six more rows, closing at **108 rows: 99 GATED, 9
  PARTIAL, 0 NO GATE** — one per capability whose gate this release built:
  authorized approvals, the signed email link, the LLM input contract across
  both services, rule-id agreement between engine and catalogue, which identity
  providers can resolve permissions live, and config snapshots reaching the
  graph. Four carry a named caveat rather than a clean claim, because the
  limitation is real: approvals are still an in-process dict, the contract is
  a leak control rather than an injection sanitizer, four of five posture
  snapshots cannot be collected, and `is_current` is set on write and never
  cleared.
- **The wave-2 backlog in [#362](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/362)
  was wrong in both directions.** Two items (business-context rules,
  effective-permissions resolvers) were already built, and four had the
  capability present with the path that feeds it broken — which is the same
  shape v8.0 found a dozen times. Auditing each item against the tree before
  writing code is now the first step of any wave, not an optional one.

- **A rule id named one rule in the engine and a different one in the
  catalogue.** #697 made ids position-independent by pinning
  `(category, slug) → rule_id` in `detections/rule-ids.lock.json`, but nothing
  reconciled the lock against the YAML already on disk and the `--check` mode
  was never written, so the committed pack fell **45 network rule ids** behind
  the generator. Because the id is the join key between an alert and its
  catalogue entry, the effect was not a stale file: `det-network-037` fired as
  "DNS TXT Response Over 250 Bytes From Non-Resolver Host" and published — in
  the YAML, `marketplace/index.json` and the curated coverage manifest — as
  "DNS Tunnel Indicator: Long Hex Subdomain Sequence". An analyst taking a rule
  id off an alert and looking it up read a different rule's description,
  false-positive notes and playbook. Precisely the harm the lock's own
  docstring warns about.
  Three things were wrong at once, and each hid the next:
  - `export_detection_ruleset.py` still computed ids **positionally**
    (`seen[category] += 1`) under a comment saying it mirrored
    `generate_detections.py` — true when written, false once the generator
    moved to the lock. Two generators with two numbering schemes. It reads the
    lock now, so there is one source of id truth, and inserting a spec no
    longer moves an id the alert table already references.
  - `generate_detections.py` had no `--check`, so nobody could see the drift.
    It has one, it reports moved ids separately from other changes because a
    moved id is the serious case, and it runs in
    `validate-detections.yml`.
  - `tests/test_detection_id_stability.py` compared `assign_ids()` output
    against the lock — and `assign_ids()` reads the lock, so for the property
    that matters the comparison was circular. Six tests passed throughout,
    under a docstring describing this exact failure. Four new tests compare the
    published surfaces against **each other** in both directions: YAML against
    the lock, the engine against the lock, and — stating the user-visible
    property directly — that an id names the same rule in the engine and in the
    catalogue. The reordering test had to *reorder* specs rather than assert a
    re-export is a no-op, because the lock was seeded from the current spec
    order, so the two schemes agree until the day someone inserts a rule; it
    moves 81 engine ids against the old exporter.

## [8.0.0] — 2026-09-22

**Close the loop.** v8.0 was reserved for the package-publish milestone. That
turned out to be the wrong thing to name a major release after, because a
competitive read of the AI-SOC market says buyers are not choosing on
distribution — they are choosing on whether the platform can prove it did
what it said. So v8.0 is the release that connects capabilities the codebase
already contained but never wired together, and the npm/PyPI publish moves to
v8.1 where it belongs.

The pattern across almost every item below is the same, and it is worth
stating plainly: the mechanism existed, was tested in isolation, and had no
caller on the path that needed it. A passing unit test on an uncalled function
is indistinguishable from a working feature until someone traces the call
graph.

### Added

- **Response actions are verified against the vendor.** Outcome verification is
  the line the market draws between a tool that recommends and one that
  responds. `AutonomyDecision.requires_verification` was computed for every
  auto-executed action at MEDIUM blast radius and above, and the dispatcher
  dropped it; `PostActionVerifier` had no caller outside its own test. The
  dispatcher now re-queries after a real, successful execution and records the
  outcome. A vendor that accepts the call while the effect is absent downgrades
  the action to FAILED instead of leaving it reported as succeeded — that gap
  is how a SOC comes to believe a host is contained when it is not.
  `unverified` stays `unverified` and is never upgraded to a confirmation.
- **The isolation probe reads real containment state.** It previously returned
  `bool(device_id)`, true for every host in the fleet, so it would certify an
  uncontained host as verified. Adds `get_containment_status` to the
  CrowdStrike client; `containment_pending` deliberately does not count. A new
  probe covers `block_ip` by re-reading the enforcing security-group rules.
- **Autonomy is governed by the tenant's own policy.** The console has written
  a per-tenant L0–L4 tier, per-action overrides and a HIGH-blast whitelist to
  Postgres since v7.6; the dispatcher read none of it and resolved autonomy
  from one deployment-wide `AISOC_MATURITY_TIER`. Every tenant in a
  multi-tenant install shared a posture, and a tenant who selected L2 in the UI
  got whatever the operator had exported. `maturity.evaluate_gate` — the
  function that does understand per-tenant policy — had no callers anywhere.
  The `whitelisted` flag is now passed to `decide()`; it had been left at its
  default of False, which made the L4 break-glass path unreachable.
- **Analysts can hunt the events AiSOC itself ingested.** Every connector's
  events are archived to ClickHouse `aisoc.raw_events`, and nothing could query
  them: `/nl-query/execute` only ever executed against Elasticsearch, so a
  tenant whose data lives in the platform's own lake got "ES_URL not
  configured" and could not query anything they had ingested. The translator's
  structured IR now compiles to parameterised ClickHouse SQL, with the tenant
  predicate generated as part of the WHERE clause rather than rewritten in
  afterwards, and no analyst text reaching the SQL string.
- **Auto-escalated alerts get the context manual ones get.** The manual
  investigator has built a `ContextBundle` — graph neighbourhood, blast radius,
  historical verdicts for the same entities, UEBA baselines — since v7.5. The
  escalation path never did, so the high-volume automatic route investigated a
  true positive knowing nothing about how identical alerts had resolved before.

### Fixed

- **Repeat-alert suppression could never fire.** v7.7 shipped the compounding
  loop as "a repeat alert matching a trusted benign prior is auto-resolved
  without re-triage", measured as `repeat_alerts_suppressed` on
  `/metrics/funnel`. The signature was `evidence_fingerprint(tenant,
  raw_alert)`, and `raw_alert` carries the alert row id, the source event ids
  and the raw event payload — all unique per alert. Every alert hashed to a
  unique fingerprint, so each outcome prior was written under a key nothing
  would look up again and the metric could only ever report zero. Two features
  were dead, not one: every repeat also paid for a fresh LLM triage the dedup
  cache should have served for nothing. `test_outcome_memory.py` missed it
  because it calls `record_outcome` and `lookup_prior` with the same literal
  signature string, which holds for any key scheme including a broken one.
- **Three services were fully unauthenticated.** `purple-team`, `honeytokens`
  and `ueba` each mounted their entire API with no authentication, so anyone
  who could reach the port could launch attack simulations, mint or read
  honeytokens, and read per-user behavioural risk scores. Auth is applied at
  the router level so a route added later is protected by default.
- **The live-action router had no authentication.** `/api/v1/live-actions`
  reaches `dispatch()`, which isolates hosts, disables accounts and blocks IPs
  against live vendors, while the legacy actions router mounted beside it had
  required a service token on every mutating route since it was written.
- **Two cross-tenant leaks in the entity graph.** `get_entity_neighbors`
  accepted a `tenant_id` and never used it — no predicate in the Cypher, and
  the parameter was not even passed to the driver — so naming any node id
  returned another tenant's host, user or IOC plus every neighbour with full
  properties. `get_blast_radius` filtered only the traversal's start node and
  accepted `tenant_id IS NULL`, so an APOC expansion could leave the tenant's
  estate through a shared entity and enumerate another tenant's hosts and
  users. Every node of every path is now scoped, through one shared predicate.
- **Business-context rules never reached triage.** The API stored them in a
  module-level dict inside whichever process served the write, and the
  auto-triage worker loaded rules only from a YAML file whose path nothing
  sets. A tenant could author "this host is a domain controller, escalate
  anything touching it", see it saved, preview it against their last 50
  alerts, and have it apply to no triage decision ever. Migration 050 adds
  `aisoc_business_context_rule_sets` and the worker resolves per tenant from it.
- **Verdicts could auto-close on reasoning the evidence contradicts.**
  `score_groundedness` measures what fraction of the indicators an output
  asserts actually appear in the evidence, and had no caller in the service. A
  confident `false_positive` citing an IP that appeared nowhere in the alert
  was persisted, written back as a prior that would suppress future alerts, and
  closed. Auto-closing verdicts below the floor are now demoted to
  `needs_review` with the unsupported indicators named in the findings.
- **The tool-calling loop bypassed the LLM input contract.** `run_with_tools`
  feeds tool output straight back into the prompt, and tool output is
  untrusted: a SIEM row or threat-intel record can carry text that reads as an
  instruction. Calling `bound.ainvoke` directly skipped injection validation on
  the highest-risk content in the system and lost cost telemetry for every turn.
- **QRadar could never be federated to.** `to_aql` is written, exported and
  tested, and the QRadar connector implements `federated_search` with it. The
  type was missing from the API's `FEDERATED_CAPABLE_TYPES`, so a tenant with
  an enabled QRadar connector was silently excluded from every federated search.
- **The API-keys panel issued keys that authenticated nothing.** It generated
  an `aisoc_live_…` secret in the browser with `crypto.getRandomValues`, told
  the user to save it because it would not be shown again, and never sent it
  anywhere. Someone would paste it into a CI pipeline or a forwarder and get
  silent 401s while believing they held a working credential. Revoking filtered
  a row out of local state. The real CRUD backend existed all along.
- **Fabricated security data rendered as tenant state across 24 components.**
  Alerts, cases, connectors, playbooks, detections, hunt, attack graph, threat
  intel, SLA, audit, RBAC, purple team, identity permissions, EASM and shift
  handoff each served a `MOCK_*` / `DEMO_*` array when the API call failed,
  none of it gated on demo mode. A fabricated alert is indistinguishable from a
  real one, and the worst of them invented things a customer makes decisions
  from: MITRE coverage claiming which techniques they can detect, SLA
  percentages, an external attack surface with a risk score. It also persisted
  — SWR v2 disables `revalidateOnMount` whenever `fallbackData` is supplied, so
  most of these were not first-paint placeholders but what the view showed.
- **Executor rollbacks did not call the vendor.** `isolate_host`,
  `disable_user` and `suspend_session` logged an intent and returned True, so
  an operator who rolled back a lockout was told the account was restored while
  it stayed disabled. The real reverse calls existed in `app.services.rollback`
  with no caller outside their own test.
- **Three unreachable routes.** `GET /assets/vulnerabilities` and the agents'
  `/hunts/runs` and `/hunts/findings` were registered after a parameterised
  `/{id}` route that shadowed them.
- **The osquery playbook step crashed on import.** It imported client modules
  from `app.clients.*`, which does not exist in `services/agents`, so every
  such step died with an unhandled `ModuleNotFoundError` — and the NL playbook
  drafter actively offers this step type.
- **A saved hunt's "run" button ran nothing.** It re-translated the question,
  stamped `last_run_at` and returned, so the console showed "last run just now"
  for a hunt that had queried nothing.
- **Generated content was presented as real findings.** A fabricated APT
  attribution in the alert detail view, synthetic hunt hits, and
  template-fallback copilot replies now declare their provenance.

### Changed

- **The v8.0 milestone is the close-the-loop release; package publishing moves
  to v8.1.** `@aisoc/mcp`, `@aisoc/sdk`, `aisoc-cli`, `aisoc-sdk`,
  `aisoc-plugin-sdk` and `aisoc-sandbox` remain unpublished and the README
  points at monorepo-local invocations. `publish-cli.yml` is OIDC-provenance
  ready and no-ops with a clear notice rather than faking a publish; it needs
  an `NPM_TOKEN` secret and a PyPI trusted publisher, which are account-level
  settings rather than code.
- **Nine new rows in the claim-to-gate matrix**, one per capability above, each
  naming the test that fails if the wiring regresses. 73 rows: 62 GATED, 11
  PARTIAL, 0 NO GATE.
- **New CI gate `check_mock_data_gated.py`** fails the build on a
  `fallbackData` receiving sample data un-wrapped, or sample data assigned to
  state with no demo-mode check.

### Fixed (carried from the unreleased section)

- **UEBA can no longer read an unscoreable baseline as normal behaviour.** A
  feature that had never been observed, had too few samples, or had zero
  variance produced a `0.0` z-score — the same value an observation sitting
  exactly on its own mean produces. Since the composite is a root-sum-of-
  squares, that zero contributed nothing and the entity read as all-clear;
  service accounts, batch jobs and automation users converge on a constant
  stream, so they could not raise an anomaly at all. `compute_z_score` now
  returns `None` for these cases and callers exclude it. Per-feature composites
  are unchanged (`0.0 ** 2` already contributed nothing), but a peer group
  whose features are all degenerate now yields no peer signal instead of a
  `0.0` that halved the caller's personal composite — a `critical` score was
  being reported as `medium`. Affected feature names are logged at `info`.
  A new `MIN_BASELINE_SAMPLES` setting (default 30) gates the sample count.

- **Agent investigations are now persisted to the ledger (issue #601).** The
  demo seed renames the canonical seed tenant's slug from `default` to `demo`,
  so the agents service's `tenant_ref="default"` fallback matched no tenant and
  every investigation was silently skipped (`ledger.skip_run
  reason=unknown_tenant` at `debug`) after already spending compute. Two fixes:
  the API now forwards the authenticated `tenant_id` to the agents service on
  `/cases/{id}/investigate` (the run is attributed to the real tenant), and the
  ledger resolver maps the `"default"` placeholder to the canonical seed tenant
  (stable UUID, regardless of its current slug) or the sole tenant in a
  single-tenant install. A genuinely unresolvable tenant now logs at `warning`
  with the run/case id, not `debug`.

## [7.7.0] — 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Self-service data lifecycle (Wave 5).** (1) **Configurable retention**
  (`/data-lifecycle/retention`): per-tenant windows (days) for `raw_events`
  (lake) / `alerts` / `audit`, clamped to `[1, 3650]`, with a bounded
  **tenant-scoped** ClickHouse purge and a parameterised Postgres purge (W5.1).
  (2) A **field-extraction / transform DSL** (`pipeline_transforms`): a safe,
  whitelisted, no-`eval` pipeline (`rename` / `copy` / `set` / `set_default` /
  `drop` / `lowercase` / `uppercase` / `coalesce` / grok-style `extract` with
  dotted paths + named captures) that reshapes events onto OCSF; the `extract`
  op compiles a `%{TOKEN:name}` template from `re.escape`d literals + a fixed
  linear-time token map, so it is ReDoS-proof by construction (no raw user
  regex); validation rejects unknown ops/tokens and oversized pipelines;
  runtime is fail-open per op and never mutates the input (W5.3). (3) **Runtime custom parsers**
  (`/data-lifecycle/parsers` + `/parsers/test`): a parser is a named,
  tenant-scoped, validated transform pipeline you can register and dry-run
  against a sample event (W5.2). Gated by `test_retention.py` +
  `test_pipeline_transforms.py`.
- **Customizable dashboard / report builder (Wave 7).** A declarative report is
  a list of widgets (whitelisted `type` × data `source`), validated for unknown
  types/sources, duplicate ids, and bounded size, then rendered by resolving
  each widget's data server-side — resilient to a failing/missing resolver (one
  bad widget renders an `error`, never breaks the report). `POST
  /report-builder/validate` + `/render` (the latter wires the real tenant-scoped
  `alerts_by_severity` resolver). The same definition can drive the live
  dashboard and an exported report. Gated by `test_report_builder.py` (8 cases).
- **Compliance mapping + agentless CSPM + destinations (Wave 6).** (1) An
  **agentless CSPM scan engine** (`cspm.scan_resources` + `POST /posture/scan`):
  evaluates a read-only cloud-resource snapshot against misconfiguration checks
  (public/unencrypted S3, world-open security groups on sensitive ports, IAM
  users without MFA / stale keys, public/unencrypted RDS, unencrypted EBS),
  emitting findings with severity + control refs (W6.2). (2) **Compliance
  control mapping with auto-evidence** (`compliance_mapping`): CSPM findings and
  fired detections (via MITRE) map to CIS / SOC 2 controls and mint dated
  evidence records automatically (W6.1). (3) **Notification/SOAR destinations**
  (`destinations` + `POST /posture/destinations/preview`): Opsgenie, email, and
  a generic `aisoc.handoff.v1` external-SOAR webhook, with an SSRF guard on
  outbound targets (W6.3). Gated by `test_compliance_cspm.py` (14 cases).
- **Invoking-identity scoping for response actions (Wave 4).** An
  `ActionPrincipal` (user id + tenant + roles + permissions) now rides on every
  `ActionRequest` (W4.1). The actions service enforces **least-privilege**: an
  action only runs if its principal holds the permission its blast radius
  demands (`actions:execute:{low,medium,high}`, higher tiers granting lower;
  `actions:*` granting all), with tenant binding (W4.2). The mutating action
  routes require a service bearer token and **fail closed** in production when
  unconfigured (W4.3). Approvals are **bound**: an approver must hold the
  action's permission and cannot approve their own request (separation of
  duties, W4.4). Gated by `test_authz.py` (10 cases).
- **Three detection-authoring modes (Wave 3).** (1) A **Python detection
  framework** (`packages/aisoc-detections`): write detections as
  `def rule(event) -> bool` + metadata + inline positive/negative `TESTS`,
  complementing the YAML/Sigma corpus; a fixture harness fails a blind rule
  (misses a positive) or a noisy one (fires on a negative), `evaluate()` is
  fail-closed, and a CI gate (`python-detections.yml`) runs it. Ships a CLI
  (`aisoc-detections`) + example detections. (2) An **AI Detection Builder**
  (`POST /nl-detection/propose`): a plain-English threat description becomes a
  Sigma rule with **auto-generated** positive/negative fixtures **derived from
  the rule's own selection** (not invented by the LLM), run through the
  non-circular eval-gate, and opened as a governed DRAFT proposal. (3) A
  **no-code / simple detection builder** (`SimpleRuleBuilder`): a form
  (field/operator/value rows) compiles to a valid Sigma rule dropped into the
  governed editor. Also fixes a real bug: `detection_loop` / the Wave-1 tuner +
  hunt bridge inserted into a non-existent `aisoc_detection_rule_proposals`
  table (the real table is `detection_rule_proposals`).
- **Detection backtesting over the event lake (Wave 2).** New
  `POST /api/v1/rules/{rule_id}/backtest` runs a candidate detection rule against
  REAL historical events in the tenant-scoped ClickHouse lake
  (`aisoc.raw_events`) over a bounded window and reports exactly how many events
  would have fired (`would_fire`), the `hit_rate`, and sample matches — so an
  engineer can see a rule's noise on real history before promoting it, instead of
  only testing against hand-crafted fixtures. The source filter is
  injection-sanitised and the SELECT is tenant-rewritten via
  `lake_sql.rewrite_for_tenant`. Read-only (`rules:read`). Gate: `test_backtest.py`.
  Also `POST /detection-proposals/{id}/backtest` attaches the result to the
  proposal's `eval_result["backtest"]` as a third promotion signal, with an
  opt-in `AISOC_BACKTEST_MAX_HIT_RATE` gate that blocks `/decide` approval for
  rules too noisy over history (W2.2, `test_backtest_gate.py`), and the rule
  editor gains a "Backtest over history" panel (W2.3).
- **Closed loop: outcomes compound, repeat alerts auto-suppress (Wave 1).** Every
  durable auto-triage outcome is now written back as a per-signature institutional
  prior (`services/agents/app/memory/outcomes.py`), and a later alert matching a
  trusted prior benign/false-positive disposition is auto-resolved WITHOUT
  re-triage — human priors are trusted immediately, AI priors require corroboration
  (repeat count + high confidence), and a prior true-positive never auto-closes a
  future alert. Suppressions are recorded to `aisoc_outcome_suppressions`
  (migration 048) and surfaced as a measured `repeat_alerts_suppressed` /
  `repeat_suppression_rate` on `GET /metrics/funnel`. Fusion now applies a bounded
  (±0.10), per-tenant institutional-memory nudge to fuse-time confidence
  (`MemoryPriorProvider` distils disposition history; refreshed on a cadence),
  scheduled hunt findings open governed DRAFT `DetectionRuleProposal`s
  (`hunt-finding` source), and the previously-orphaned disposition-history tuner is
  wired via `POST /detection/tuning/auto-suggest`. Gates: `test_outcome_memory.py`,
  `test_memory_nudge.py`, `test_wave1_loop_edges.py`; claim-to-gate matrix +4.
- **LLM gateway (LiteLLM) — task-based model routing + observability
  ([#478](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/478), PR1).** New `litellm`
  service in `docker-compose.yml` as the single entry point for live LLM calls.
  AiSOC requests a **logical task alias** (`aisoc-triage`, `aisoc-recon`,
  `aisoc-investigation`, `aisoc-copilot`, `aisoc-summary`, `aisoc-report`,
  `aisoc-nl`); the alias → real-model mapping lives entirely in
  `infra/litellm/config.yaml`, so operators assign different local or hosted
  models per task — and swap them — without any AiSOC code change (commented
  Ollama/vLLM/Anthropic examples ship in the config). Per-task latency, tokens,
  cost, errors, retries, and fallbacks are exported on `/metrics` and scraped by
  the bundled Prometheus (new `aisoc-litellm` job; the third-party image is
  allowlisted in `scripts/audit_prometheus_targets.py`). Opt-in and
  non-breaking: unset `OPENAI_BASE_URL` keeps calls going direct to the provider,
  and the deterministic offline path is unaffected. Docs:
  `apps/docs/docs/operations/llm-gateway.md`; config test
  `services/agents/tests/test_litellm_config.py`. (A follow-up PR wires the ~10
  in-code callsites to request these aliases via `model_pins` and removes the
  hardcoded `gpt-4o-mini` default, closing #478.)
- **LLM task-alias routing — no more shipped default model
  ([#478](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/478), PR2).** Every live LLM
  call now asks for a **logical task alias** instead of a hardcoded model. New
  `services/agents/app/llm/factory.py` (`make_chat_model` / `resolve_model_alias`)
  resolves a task role to its `aisoc-<role>` alias + the gateway base URL;
  `model_pins.py` now pins all seven roles (triage, recon, investigation, copilot,
  summary, report, nl) to aliases with a `deterministic` floor. The ~10 scattered
  `os.getenv("AISOC_LLM_MODEL"/"OPENAI_MODEL","gpt-4o-mini")` + `ChatOpenAI(...)` /
  raw-HTTP callsites across the agents (auto-triage, cloud/identity/insider/
  phishing, recon/forensic/responder/report-writer, copilot, contextual, NL
  translator) and the API endpoints (translation, hunts, knowledge base, phishing;
  via new `services/api/app/services/model_aliases.py`) now request aliases; the
  hardcoded `gpt-4o-mini` default is gone. **Behaviour change:** live LLM now runs
  through the gateway (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`), or pin a concrete model per role via
  `AISOC_MODEL_PIN_<ROLE>` (escape hatch; the slim demo does this so keyed demos
  keep working); with neither, the deterministic offline path is used. Tests:
  `services/agents/tests/test_llm_factory.py` + tightened `test_litellm_config.py`.
  Closes #478.
- **v8 P4 — Compounding Memory (verdicts that measurably improve).** New
  `services/fusion/app/memory/`: a nightly-distillable institutional memory that
  makes verdicts more accurate the longer an instance runs. **Distillation**
  (`distill.py`) compresses analyst overrides + verdict history into two
  versioned (content-hashed), ledger-referenceable outputs — per-signature
  priors (FP rate + prior) and a top-N few-shot exemplar bank per category.
  **Memory verdict stage** (`stage.py`) turns a signature's prior into a
  **bounded** verdict delta capped at ±0.10 (nudge, never dominate; cap +
  direction unit-tested). **Improvement telemetry** (`improvement.py`) computes
  verdict precision over time + the lift from install to latest ("N% more
  accurate than at install") — measured 0.60→0.90 on a simulated (clearly
  labelled synthetic) 90-day override history. **Portable signed memory packs**
  (`pack.py`) — `aisoc memory export` (`pnpm aisoc:memory:export -- --demo`)
  distills + **Ed25519-signs** a pack so an MSSP can bootstrap a child tenant
  from a curated baseline; import verifies the signature and rejects a tampered
  pack + can pin the publisher key (round-trip + tamper-rejection tests). The
  `aisoc-memory-pack` format is the marketplace memory-pack artifact type. 9
  tests (auto-run in the fusion CI job); docs
  `apps/docs/docs/concepts/compounding-memory.md`. (Nightly distill scheduling,
  the dashboard improvement chart, and live-path consumption of the memory stage
  are the documented remaining integration steps.)
- **v8 P3 — Investigation Swarm (parallel hypothesis agents).** New
  `services/agents/app/swarm/`: for hard cases, fan out 3–5 competing hypothesis
  agents in parallel, then run a structured debate node that ranks them.
  **Complexity gate** (`complexity.py`) fires the swarm only above an
  entity/technique-spread threshold (defaults ≥3/≥3); simple alerts stay on the
  cheaper single-agent path. **Hypotheses** (`hypotheses.py`) — ransomware
  staging, insider exfil, lateral movement, C2 beacon, and a benign
  backup/maintenance FP — each with supporting/contradicting signal +
  corroborating techniques. **Swarm** (`swarm.py`) runs the agents concurrently
  (`asyncio.gather`) each under a per-agent token budget, so total spend is
  bounded. **Debate** (`debate.py`) scores hypotheses on explicit criteria
  (evidence coverage, contradiction count, institutional-memory prior) and emits
  a ranked list with margin-based confidence, recorded as a first-class new
  `debate` ledger step type (the public replay UI colors + renders it). **Eval
  gate** `tests/test_swarm_vs_single.py` publishes both numbers and asserts the
  swarm beats single-agent on the investigation-completeness macro by ≥10% under
  a cost ceiling (measured lift +0.556 on the synthetic set) — added to the
  agents CI job. Completeness is a **substrate self-consistency** macro (breadth
  of hypotheses considered), explicitly not a live-LLM accuracy claim; the
  incident set is labelled synthetic. Docs:
  `apps/docs/docs/concepts/investigation-swarm.md`. 9 tests.
- **v8 P2 — Self-Play Purple Team (the SOC that attacks itself).** New
  `services/purple-team/app/adversary/`: turns the purple-team service from a
  test runner into a continuous adversary. **Hard scope guard**
  (`scope_guard.py`) — a SOC that attacks itself must never touch production, so
  this is enforced in **code** (raises `ScopeViolation` before any step) not as
  a prompt: every target must carry an allowlisted lab tag AND no forbidden
  production tag; no force flag. Adversarial tests cover production assets,
  untagged assets, empty target sets, and a `lab`+`crown-jewel` laundering
  attempt (all hard-fail). **Planner** (`planner.py`) composes an ordered
  kill-chain (initial-access → execution → persistence → privesc → exfil),
  selecting only techniques whose platform exists among the lab targets ("attack
  what exists"). **Closed loop** (`campaign.py`) emits telemetry per step
  (pluggable: in-memory for tests/canned, Kafka on the live path), a detection
  oracle scores detected/missed, and computes detection rate + mean-time-to-
  verdict. **DAC auto-file** (`dac.py`) files one eval-gated Sigma-scaffold
  proposal per miss (status `proposed`, low confidence — self-play can only
  propose, never silently merge). **Scoreboard** (`scoreboard.py` +
  `apps/docs/static/data/selfplay-scoreboard.json`) with a per-row `synthetic`
  flag so a canned campaign is never mistaken for a measured live run. Canned
  5-stage campaign via `pnpm aisoc:selfplay` (offline, deterministic, ~seconds)
  runs in CI through `test_canned_campaign_runs_end_to_end`. 14 tests total; docs
  at `apps/docs/docs/concepts/self-play.md`. (Nightly live wiring — Kafka emitter
  + alert-store oracle + HTTP DAC filer into the scheduler — is the documented
  remaining integration step.)
- **v8 P1 — Federated Threat Intel Mesh (the network effect).** New
  `services/mesh/` (Python/FastAPI, port 8010): opt-in gossip of two
  privacy-preserving artifact types between self-hosted instances via a
  lightweight, open-source hub. (1) **IOC sightings** — `SHA-256` of the
  normalized indicator (never the raw value) + coarse type + severity +
  first/last-seen; private-set-intersection style, so a peer learns a value only
  if it already has it. (2) **Verdict signatures** — the institutional-memory
  signature key (category + connector + technique) + verdict distribution + mean
  confidence; no entities, tenant data, or free text. **Privacy gates:**
  k-anonymity (consensus revealed only at `>= k` distinct instances, default 5,
  `AISOC_MESH_K`), per-instance **Ed25519** signing (verified hub-side, so one
  actor can't inflate consensus with sock-puppets — tested), tenant/rule-level
  opt-out, a per-instance outbound-audit receipts log, and a `mesh_preview` that
  shows the exact outbound payload before sharing is enabled. **Consumption:** a
  deterministic `consensus.py:mesh_contribution` verdict stage bounded to
  **±0.10** (the mesh nudges, never dominates; cap unit-tested). Public network
  stats page at `/mesh` (fetches the hub's `/v1/stats`, graceful when the hub is
  offline). 11 tests cover the full privacy contract (k-anonymity threshold,
  sock-puppet resistance, Ed25519 verify, PSI hashing, opt-out, bounded
  contribution, preview redaction, two-instance exchange, per-instance audit);
  added to the wave-2 service CI matrix. Threat model:
  `docs/architecture/mesh.md`; `SECURITY.md` gains a mesh disclosure policy. The
  measured FP-suppression lift (mesh on vs. off) is explicitly deferred and
  labelled **simulated-until-measured** on the benchmark/`/mesh` pages — never
  presented as measured production performance.
- **v8 G1 — launch kit (ships in-repo with the code).** New `marketing/launch/`:
  a Show HN draft centered on `npx aisoc triage --demo`, a 90-second demo-video
  shot list (CLI wow → replay permalink → self-play → mesh stats), Product Hunt
  assets, six technical blog outlines (one per phase, each ending in a
  reproducible command), and a **category-level** comparison dossier vs.
  closed-source AI SOC products — deliberately **without naming any competitor**
  (per project policy), with every AiSOC-side claim linked to code or a CI gate.
  Plus a `docs/press/` kit (boilerplate, fast facts, logo kit, naming). All
  materials are written to two rules — no superlatives, and synthetic-vs-measured
  always labelled — and are linked from `CONTRIBUTING.md` for community
  amplification. The launch-kit README points every claim back to the benchmark
  page + claim-to-gate matrix so nothing ungated gets published.
- **v8 W4 — GitHub-native distribution (`aisoc-action`).** New
  `packages/aisoc-action/` (Node20 JS action, **dependency-free** — a
  hand-rolled Actions runtime + a `fetch`-based GitHub REST client, deliberately
  no `@actions/*`/octokit so the shipped bundle carries no vulnerable `undici`;
  the committed bundle is 18 KB): triages the repo's **own**
  security signals — Dependabot alerts, CodeQL/code-scanning findings, and
  secret-scanning alerts — with the deterministic AiSOC verdict engine (no LLM,
  nothing leaves the runner) and posts verdicts + suppression rationale +
  prioritization as a PR comment (idempotent update-in-place), a job summary, or
  a weekly `aisoc-digest` posture issue with an A–F grade and week-over-week
  delta. Runtime-scope Dependabot vulns are prioritized as
  exploitable-in-your-dependency-graph ("3 of 41 findings are act-now"); sources
  the token can't read degrade gracefully. Inputs: `mode`, `min-severity`,
  `fail-on` (gate mode), `sources`. The verdict engine is a byte-for-byte
  vendored copy of `packages/aisoc-lite/src/verdict/` kept in sync by
  `scripts/sync_vendored_verdict.py` (CI `--check` gate), bundled into a
  committed `dist/index.js`. Dogfooded on this repo via
  `.github/workflows/aisoc-selfscan.yml`. CI (`aisoc-action.yml`): sync-check +
  typecheck + 6 fixture tests + a dist-freshness gate (committed bundle must
  match a fresh build). Docs: `apps/docs/docs/integrations/github-action.md`
  with copy-paste PR + digest workflows. **Fixes a latent workspace defect:** the
  monorepo root package was also named `aisoc` (colliding with the CLI package),
  so it was renamed to `aisoc-monorepo` (installer repo-detection sentinels now
  prefix-match, staying compatible with existing clones).
- **v8 W2 — standalone free web tools (search-indexed acquisition).** Four
  login-free, open-source tools under `apps/web/src/app/(tools)/tools/`, each
  with its own landing page, JSON-LD, OG metadata, and an "open source, part of
  AiSOC" backlink; **everything runs in the browser — user rules never touch the
  server** (the deterministic path is pure client-side). (1) **Detection
  Translator** (`/tools/translate`): paste any rule, get Sigma / SPL / KQL /
  ES\|QL / YARA-L2 / UDM at once, with per-dialect copy buttons and a stable
  `?s=` permalink. (2) **NL → Detection** (`/tools/nl2sigma`): plain English →
  a Sigma scaffold plus the three SIEM dialects, via a deterministic
  artifact-extraction generator (honest about being a starting point). (3)
  **ATT&CK Coverage Grader** (`/tools/coverage`): paste Sigma rules / technique
  IDs → an A–F grade, a per-tactic heatmap, the top-10 highest-prevalence
  uncovered techniques, and a downloadable shareable grade card (via
  `@aisoc/report-card`). (4) **Alert Noise Calculator** (`/tools/noise`):
  project FP suppression + analyst hours/cost saved from the published
  deterministic-tier suppression rate (methodology linked; labelled as a
  substrate figure, not a live-LLM claim). SEO plumbing: 30 programmatic
  format-pair landing pages (`/tools/translate/spl-to-kql`, …) generated from a
  matrix via `generateStaticParams`, plus sitemap entries for all tool routes.
  Logic (`apps/web/src/lib/tools/`) is pure and unit-tested (13 tests: translate
  field-map + permalink round-trip, coverage extraction/grading/top-uncovered,
  noise projection/clamping, NL→Sigma scaffolding). Production build verified
  (tools static, pair pages SSG'd).
- **v8 W3 — shareable investigation artifacts (the screenshot loop).** Public,
  immutable, redacted investigation-replay permalinks. New
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/replay.py`: `POST /ledger/{run_id}/publish/preview`
  builds a redacted snapshot **and returns the alias map** so the publisher
  reviews exactly what will be hidden (the pre-publish diff) before confirming;
  `POST /ledger/{run_id}/publish` (needs `confirm=true`) re-builds server-side
  and stores an immutable `published_replays` row (migration `045`, with an
  UPDATE-blocking trigger that only allows the view counter to change); public
  `GET /r/{slug}` serves the snapshot without auth from a non-RLS session
  (the data is post-redaction and non-identifying by design). Redaction reuses
  the reversible `Pseudonymizer` (vendored into the API via
  `scripts/sync_vendored_redactor.py`): internal IPs / emails / paths / secrets
  / internal hostnames / usernames become aliases, while public IOCs + ATT&CK
  techniques are preserved as the shareable value; only the redacted snapshot is
  persisted, never the alias map (`services/api/app/services/replay_redaction.py`).
  Web: a public `/r/[slug]` page renders an animated playback (timeline scrubber,
  evidence cards, growing attack graph, verdict stamp with elapsed time) with a
  dynamic `next/og` Open Graph image for X/LinkedIn/Slack unfurls;
  shields.io-compatible badge endpoints at `/api/badge/<kind>`. New shared
  `packages/@aisoc/report-card` renders triage / coverage-grade / replay share
  cards (SVG + Markdown) and is now the canonical renderer behind the CLI
  `--share` flag (bundled into `aisoc` at build time). The seeded LockBit case
  `INC-RT-001` is published as the canonical demo replay at `/r/demo-lockbit`.
  Tests: redaction (no raw PII survives, public IOCs preserved), report-card
  renderers, badge endpoint, and the replay fetch client. `docs/openapi.yaml`
  regenerated (+284 lines, additions only).
- **v8 W1 — `npx aisoc` wedge CLI (the 60-second wow).** New `packages/aisoc-lite/` (TypeScript, published to npm as `aisoc`, one runtime dependency): a zero-install front door that triages a batch of alerts to verdicts in under a minute with **no credentials and no LLM key**. `npx aisoc triage --demo` runs a bundled, fully-deterministic 200-alert fixture in ~50 ms and prints a terminal verdict table plus the copy-pasteable headline "AiSOC triaged 200 alerts: 12 TP, 171 FP suppressed (85.5% noise), 17 need review". The verdict engine (`src/verdict/stages.ts`) is a faithful port of the production triage scorer `services/agents/app/confidence/scoring.py` — the weight stack and band thresholds (≥.80 TP, ≥.60 likely-TP, ≥.40 review, else benign; clamp [0.05, 0.95]) are pinned by a parity test so a CLI verdict lands where the full stack would. `--file alerts.jsonl` triages a local export (Splunk / Sentinel / Elastic ECS / CrowdStrike field spellings auto-detected); `--llm` refines only the ambiguous `needs_review` middle using the user's **own** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` called directly (never proxied); `--share` writes a redacted, aggregate-only report card (Markdown + 1200×630 SVG, no alert content); `translate` is a CLI front for the deterministic detection-rule field-map translator (Sigma/SPL/KQL/ES\|QL/YARA-L2/UDM); `up` boots the full demo stack from a pinned Compose bundle. Telemetry is strictly opt-in (`--telemetry` / `AISOC_TELEMETRY=1`, default off), aggregate counts only, documented in `packages/aisoc-lite/TELEMETRY.md` and asserted content-free by a unit test. 22 vitest tests. New CI: `aisoc-cli.yml` (build + typecheck + tests + a cross-platform cold `triage --demo` e2e asserting the headline and a <60 s bound + a fixture-staleness diff gate) and `publish-cli.yml` (npm publish with build provenance on a `cli-v*` tag; no-ops safely until `NPM_TOKEN` is configured — we never fake a publish). README top fold rewritten around the one-liner (guarded "lands on npm with the v8.0 launch; today it builds from `packages/aisoc-lite/`").

## [7.6.0] — 2026-07-13

**Fully-Operational AI-SOC release.** Completes the A1–E1 roadmap that wired the three end-to-end paths the reality audit found unwired — the event lake is now populated, the executable detection corpus fires on the live stream, every fused alert is auto-triaged (copilot default), and approved SOAR actions execute against real connector credentials under an autonomy policy — and adds the competitive-parity differentiators (unified Data Explorer, live effective-permissions, fuse-time attack chains, autopilot/copilot scorecard) plus nine new connectors and AI/LLM-usage governance. The claim-to-gate matrix reaches **33 GATED / 7 PARTIAL / 0 NO GATE**: every product claim is backed by a failing test, and the ratchet (`MAX_NO_GATE=0`) forbids regression.

### Added

- **Phase E1 — the last `NO GATE` is closed: every product claim is now backed by a failing test.** The public benchmark scoreboard was hand-maintained and the only automation (`wet-eval.yml`) no-ops without a funded LLM key, so nothing in per-PR CI proved the published headline number matched what the agent actually scores. New `scripts/check_scoreboard.py` makes the scoreboard **backed by a failing test**: on every PR (agents CI job) it runs the deterministic live-agent MITRE-accuracy eval over the 200-incident corpus and fails if the newest `substrate` row in `apps/docs/static/data/scoreboard.json` drifts more than 0.02 from the fresh run, the JSON breaks its schema, or a substrate row is mislabelled (honesty invariant: a deterministic number can never be quoted as live-LLM). The funded weekly `wet-eval.yml` still appends the LLM-tier (`substrate:false`) rows. A fresh `v7.5.0` substrate row (0.97 MITRE accuracy, tokens/USD = 0) is published. Claim-to-gate matrix: the last NO GATE → GATED **and** `MAX_NO_GATE` ratcheted 1 → 0 (the `security.yml` gate now fails if *any* NO GATE ever reappears); the L0–L4 row also moved PARTIAL → GATED (Phase B2 `decide()`-in-dispatch). **Matrix is now 33 GATED / 7 PARTIAL / 0 NO GATE** — the Fully-Operational roadmap (Phases A1–E1) is complete.
- **Phase D3 — live-vendor connector smoke (mock-server conformance).** The contract test proved each connector *declares* the async runtime methods; this goes further. New `services/connectors/tests/connectors/test_live_vendor_smoke.py` stands up a mock HTTP server (respx) returning realistic vendor payloads and drives each connector's **real** `test_connection()` + paginated `fetch_alerts()` HTTP path end-to-end, asserting a successful probe and that pulled events normalize to a valid five-tier severity — catching the wrong-endpoint-path / normalize-KeyErrors-on-real-shape failures a bare contract test misses. Covers the Phase D1/D2 connectors (QRadar, Exabeam, Securonix, Devo, Netskope, Windows/Sysmon, Zeek/Suricata, syslog/CEF, LLM-usage). Moves two claim-to-gate rows PARTIAL → GATED ("Connectors: schema-driven config + vault-encrypted secrets" and "Connectors: live Test connection"), retiring the Phase 10b deferral (31 GATED / 8 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase D2 — AI/LLM-usage governance + tiered lake storage.** Three pieces. (1) **AI/LLM-usage audit connector** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/llm_usage.py`) pulls OpenAI + Anthropic organization audit logs — API key creation, role grants, logging/MFA changes, project deletes — and emits the dotted `event_type` (`openai.api_key.created`, `anthropic.member.added`) that the detections match. (2) **Eight native `llm-*` detection rules** (`scripts/detection_specs_part3_application.py`): LLM API/admin-key created, owner granted, audit logging disabled (critical), MFA disabled, service-account created, project archived — regenerated into the corpus (825 executable rules) and re-exported to the fusion live-detection ruleset; verified firing end-to-end. (3) **Hot/warm/cold lake tiering** (`services/api/clickhouse/tiering/`): an opt-in ClickHouse storage policy + `002_tiering.sql` that rebinds `aisoc.raw_events` to a `tiered` policy and moves data to a cold (object/NAS) volume at 30 days, deleting at 90 — the Phase 6 tiering wired now that the lake is populated. Verified end-to-end on ClickHouse 23.8 (policy loads, table rebinds, TTL applied); a static config gate (`test_storage_tiering.py`) catches drift. Registry 77→78; connector-count + conformance-matrix + marketplace regenerated. Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (29 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase D1 — eight new connectors close the biggest coverage gaps (SIEM / NDR / edge / endpoint).** Following the connector convention (schema + registry + `plugins/<id>/plugin.yaml` + docs + `marketplace:sync`), adds: **IBM QRadar** (offenses; magnitude→severity), **Exabeam** (notable risk-scored sessions), **Securonix** (incidents; priority→severity), **Devo** (triggered alerts) — the four SIEMs the reality audit flagged as missing; **Netskope** (SASE/SWG DLP/malware/anomaly alerts, malware/DLP floored at `high`); **Windows Event / Sysmon** (WEF collector spool; severity from channel + Event ID — log clears, service installs, process-injection surfaces floored); **Zeek / Suricata NDR** (Suricata `eve.json` priority + Zeek `notice` types); and a first-class **generic syslog / CEF listener** (parses the ArcSight CEF header + extension, CEF severity 0–10 → five-tier, non-CEF lines ingested at `info`). Every connector maps onto the exact five-tier ladder and passes the schema + runtime conformance gates. Registry now 69→77 connectors; connector-count + conformance-matrix + marketplace index regenerated. 40 new unit tests (severity mapping across the ladder, CEF parser, mocked pulls); full connectors suite 791 passed at 67.37% coverage. Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (28 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase C3 — autopilot/copilot posture with a visible autonomy scorecard (defaults to copilot).** The per-action guardrail editor already let operators scope autonomy by action; C3 adds the whole-SOC posture view a CISO asks for. New `apps/web/src/components/settings/AutonomyScorecard.tsx` computes an honest posture from the *configured* policy (not fabricated runtime stats): **Copilot** (the safe default — high/critical-blast actions always require a human) vs **Autopilot** (flips only when a high/critical-blast action is configured to auto-execute), plus the distribution of actions by blast radius and auto-exec/override counts. Rendered atop the existing `AutonomyPolicyPanel`. The compute is a pure, unit-tested function; 6 vitest tests (`AutonomyScorecard.test.tsx`). Combined with the Phase B2 `AISOC_MATURITY_TIER` gate (which enforces copilot at the dispatch layer), the platform is copilot-by-default end-to-end. Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (27 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase C1 — Advanced Data Explorer: one investigation surface, no SIEM context-switch.** New `/explore` (`apps/web/src/components/explore/ExploreView.tsx`) unifies the surfaces shipped earlier in the roadmap into a single workbench: ask a question in plain English → it translates to SQL via `/api/v1/nl-query/translate` → runs against the now-populated ClickHouse event lake (`/api/v1/lake/sql`, Phase A1) → renders a BI-like table (row count, latency, referenced tables), with a raw-SQL escape hatch always available. Source tabs pivot to identity (effective permissions), config/graph, and threat intel so the analyst answers "who touched this, with what access, and is the IP known-bad?" without leaving the page. Adds a typed `lakeApi` client, sidebar + command-palette + sitemap entries. 5 vitest smoke tests (`ExploreView.test.tsx`); web type-check + full coverage gate green (395 tests). Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (26 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase C2 — Effective Permissions now resolves against a live posture snapshot.** The resolver is pure (snapshot → effective access), but the only production snapshot source was `_default_snapshot_loader` returning `{}` — so every live "what can this principal do?" call 412'd with "no policy snapshot ingested yet". New `services/api/app/services/effective_permissions/posture_loader.py` collects a real snapshot via the connector's `get_resource_config` read path: a new `POST /connectors/{id}/resource_config` endpoint (same vault-decrypt trust model as `/test` and federated `/query`) exposes it, and `HttpResourceConfigFetcher` + `collect_snapshot` assemble the resolver's snapshot. Coverage is explicit and honest — **Okta** is fully assembled here (user → groups → assigned apps → admin roles, then resolved), while **aws/azure/gcp/gws** consume a connector-provided *reconciled* snapshot (sentinel resource id `__posture_snapshot__`); a provider whose connector hasn't implemented that still 412s (we never fabricate a cloud snapshot). Wired into the endpoint behind `AISOC_EFFECTIVE_PERMISSIONS_LIVE` (default off → prior behaviour preserved), fail-soft to the 412 path on any collection error. 7 API unit tests + the connectors suite (751 passed). Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (25 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase C4 — related alerts now auto-collapse into one ordered attack chain at fuse time.** Correlation grouped alerts into incidents by shared entity and the API could compute a chain per case on demand, but nothing formed/extended a chain **as alerts arrived** — so an analyst saw N separate alerts instead of "step 3 of an intrusion on host X that began 20m ago". New `services/fusion/app/services/attack_chain_grouper.py`: for each entity an alert touches (host/user/ip) it looks up (or mints) a stable `chain_id` in Redis with a rolling window, so a follow-on alert on the same entity — or a *different* entity sharing an IP — joins the same chain. Members are ordered by MITRE kill-chain stage (initial-access → … → impact), so the assignment's `position`/`stage` reflect where in the intrusion this alert sits, not its arrival order. The fusion engine attaches the assignment to `FusedAlert.enrichments["attack_chain"]` (chain_id, position, stage, prior_alert_ids, member_count) for the UI + triage agent. Fail-soft (Redis miss/outage ⇒ no assignment). 8 unit tests; full fusion suite 130 passed at 65% coverage. Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (24 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase B4 — Business Context Rules now run on the live path (environment-specific noise reduction).** A leading AI-SOC differentiator — suppress alerts during a maintenance window, bump severity for production assets, route cloud alerts to the cloud team — existed as an engine + authoring UI in `services/api` but only ran in a dry-run preview; it never touched a live alert. New `services/agents/app/workers/business_context.py` applies the same `when`/`then` semantics (dotted-path fields + `eq/ne/lt/gt/contains/in/exists/...` comparators + `all/any/not`; effects `set_severity` / `route_to` / `tag` / `suppress`) in the auto-triage worker's post-fusion → pre-triage seam. A **suppress** rule drops the alert **before any triage spend**; severity/route/tag mutations flow into the alert the agent reasons over. Rules load from `AISOC_BUSINESS_CONTEXT_RULES_FILE` (mtime-reloaded), gated by `AISOC_BUSINESS_CONTEXT_ENABLED` (default on), fail-soft (bad/missing file ⇒ no rules applied, never an error into triage). The agents image can't import `services/api`, so the evaluator is a faithful, independently-tested re-implementation of the same documented semantics (unifying both call sites is a follow-up). 15 unit tests (`test_business_context_hotpath.py`, added to the CI agents gate). Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (23 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase B3 — rollback is real, actions are post-verified, and approval SLA timers survive restarts.** Three "honest response" gaps closed. (1) **Real rollback:** every executor's `rollback()` previously returned a bare `True` — logging "rolling back" without calling the vendor. New `services/actions/app/services/rollback.py` performs the **real** reverse via the same clients (isolate→`lift_containment`/`unisolate_machine`, block_ip→`unblock_ip`/`unblock_ip_zone`, disable_user→`enable_user`/`unsuspend_user`, suspend_session→`unsuspend_user`) and returns an honest `RollbackResult` (`reversed_` / `simulated` / `supported`) — never a fake success; a failed reverse is reported, not hidden. `autonomy_safety.REVERSIBLE_ACTIONS` now imports from this module (single source of truth) and `test_rollback.py` gates the two sets so an action can't be declared reversible without a real reverse. (2) **Post-action verification:** new `services/actions/app/services/verification.py` re-queries the vendor to confirm the effect is actually present (`VERIFIED` / `FAILED` / honest `UNVERIFIED` when no probe or no creds) — a probe error is never a false `VERIFIED`. (3) **Durable approvals:** `services/slack-bot/app/services/timer_store.py` adds a Postgres-backed `TimerStore`; the `ApprovalTimeoutScheduler` persists pending SLA timers and `recover()` re-arms them on startup (firing overdue ones promptly), so a bot restart can no longer strand a forgotten approval forever. Fail-soft to in-memory when no DB. 25 new tests across actions + slack-bot. Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (22 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase B2 — connector credentials now reach the SOAR executors, and the autonomy policy governs every real execution.** Two wiring gaps closed. (1) Executors read vendor-prefixed parameter keys (`cs_client_id`, `okta_domain`, `splunk_url` …) but connectors store schema field names (`client_id`, `domain`, `base_url` …) — nothing translated, so even fully-configured credentials never reached an executor and every action fell back to simulation. New `services/actions/app/services/credential_resolver.py` pins the per-vendor translation (15 vendors, connector-id aliases like `aws_security_hub`→`aws_security_groups`, `azure_defender`→`defender`; unknown fields dropped, never blindly forwarded), and `LiveActionRequest.auth_config` lets callers pass connector-style creds that the dispatcher resolves at the boundary. (2) The Phase 9a `autonomy_safety.decide()` policy existed but was never called on the live path (the 9b gap) — now every dispatch whose capability maps to an `ActionType` is governed **before** the executor is invoked: above-tier ⇒ downgraded to a dry-run preview; with dry-run disabled ⇒ `PENDING_APPROVAL` (executor never invoked); tier L0 ⇒ `BLOCKED`; explicit dry-run honoured unchanged; governance verdict attached to the result for the audit trail. Deployment tier via `AISOC_MATURITY_TIER` (default L1 — copilot). Also registers ten previously-missing vendor adapters (SentinelOne isolate, Entra/GWS disable-user, PAN-OS/FortiGate/Cloudflare block-ip, Jira/ServiceNow/PagerDuty create-ticket, Slack notify) so the agent can plan against them (19→29 builtins). 29 new/updated tests; full actions suite 224 passed at 64% coverage. Claim-to-gate matrix +1 GATED (21 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase B1 — the agent now auto-triages every alert off the stream (copilot default).** The core autonomy gap: investigations were manual/API-only — nothing consumed `aisoc.alerts.fused`, so "an agent that triages every alert" wasn't true out of the box. New `services/agents/app/workers/fused_alert_consumer.py` (`FusedAlertTriageWorker`) subscribes to the fused-alert topic and auto-triages each alert. **Copilot / dry-run is the default**: triage is read-only — it classifies (verdict + calibrated confidence), records the reasoning to the Investigation Ledger (best-effort), and **never dispatches a response** (proposed actions carry `requires_approval=True`; `response_dispatched` is always `False`). Tier selection is cost- and determinism-aware: cost-governor `DEDUPLICATED` reuses the cached verdict (a flood of identical alerts costs one triage), `CIRCUIT_OPEN`/`AISOC_DETERMINISTIC`/no-LLM-key falls to deterministic heuristic triage (`run_triage` — the air-gapped/CI default), otherwise LLM auto-triage with a deterministic fallback on failure. Wired into the agents lifespan (off unless `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS` is set) + compose (`depends_on: kafka`). 9 unit tests (`test_fused_alert_worker.py`, added to the CI agents gate; the job now also installs `langgraph`). Claim-to-gate matrix adds a GATED row "Agent auto-triages every alert" (20 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase A4 — the behavioral (UEBA) model now feeds alert scoring in production (the three-model story is real).** `services/ueba` continuously scored every entity and emitted `ueba.anomalies`, but fusion never consumed them — so the Semantic-graph / Behavioral-UEBA / Knowledge-LLM story was only two models live. New `services/fusion/app/services/ueba_signal.py`: the fusion consumer subscribes to `ueba.anomalies` and caches the latest per-`(tenant, entity_type, entity_id)` anomaly in Redis with a TTL (behavioral signal is time-decaying); during `FusionEngine.process`, an alert looks up the highest anomaly across its own entities (username→user, hostname→device, src/dst IP→ip) and `apply_ueba_boost` raises the alert's confidence (risk-scaled, label recomputed) and anomaly score, recording an explainable `ueba_anomaly` factor. Fail-soft throughout (Redis miss/outage or malformed message ⇒ no boost, no raise). 10 fusion unit tests; full fusion suite 122 passed at 64% coverage. Claim-to-gate matrix adds a GATED row "Three-model AI: behavioral (UEBA) model feeds alert scoring" (19 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase A3 — the default cold-boot stack is complete ("just works").** A plain `docker compose up` previously started the core services but left the connector runtime behind a `connectors` profile and graph-at-ingest OFF, so a fresh install wasn't the full spine. Now `docker-compose.yml` ships the connector runtime in the default profile (it idles harmlessly with no configured instances) and enables graph-at-ingest by default on `ingest-worker` (`AISOC_GRAPH_ENABLED=true` + Neo4j env + `depends_on`; the writer soft-fails if Neo4j is unreachable, so it never blocks ingest). `integration.yml` gains a Phase A3 gate asserting the default boot ships the connectors service **and** ingest enabled the graph writer **and** the Neo4j graph has nodes after the spine flowed — so combined with A1 (lake) and A2 (detection), a cold `up` is proven end-to-end: ingest → OCSF normalize → Kafka → ClickHouse lake + entity graph + detection engine → fused alert row. Claim-to-gate matrix: "`pnpm aisoc:demo` boots the real stack" PARTIAL → GATED (18 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase A2 — the executable detection corpus now fires on the live event stream.** The reality audit's second SIEM gap: ~939 executable rules existed but only ran in CI fixture-replay — nothing evaluated them against ingested events, so any telemetry that wasn't a vendor-asserted finding (the promoter's job) never became an alert. New `services/fusion/app/services/detection_engine.py` loads the native corpus exported to `app/data/detection_ruleset.json` (817 rules, by `scripts/export_detection_ruleset.py`) and evaluates each ingested event's connector-normalized fields — recovered from `ocsf_event["raw_data"]`, the shape the specs were authored against — via a **vendored, parity-gated** copy of the canonical `match_when` matcher (`app/services/detection_matcher.py`; `test_detection_matcher_parity.py` asserts byte-for-behaviour agreement with `scripts/generate_detections.py` over every committed fixture). Each firing rule becomes a `RawAlert` routed through the normal fusion dedup/correlate/persist pipeline. Product routing is fuzzy (correctness-first: unknown product ⇒ evaluate all). Gates: `integration.yml` posts an event matching `aws-root-account-login` and asserts the alert appears; `validate-detections.yml` drift-checks the exported ruleset; 16 fusion unit tests. Claim-to-gate matrix adds a GATED row "Detection rules fire on the live event stream" (17 GATED / 11 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE).
- **Phase A1 — the ClickHouse event lake is now populated from the live stream.** The reality audit's central SIEM gap: the `aisoc.raw_events` lake table and its `/api/v1/lake/sql` read API existed with **no writer**, so every hunt/query ran against an empty warehouse. New `services/fusion/app/services/lake_writer.py` (`LakeWriter`) archives every normalized OCSF event from the `aisoc.raw_events` Kafka topic into ClickHouse — mapping the OCSF envelope to the lake columns (IPv4→IPv4-mapped-IPv6 coercion, `DateTime64` binding, MITRE/IOC extraction), batched by size **or** age, and **fail-soft** (a ClickHouse outage drops the batch and logs, never crashes the consumer). Archival is independent of promotion (a non-promoted Medium event is still queryable), and a background periodic-flush ticker guarantees a low-traffic batch is never stranded. Wired into the fusion consumer + lifespan; `docker-compose.yml` fusion service gets ClickHouse env + `depends_on`. `integration.yml` gains a Phase A1 gate asserting `SELECT count() FROM aisoc.raw_events > 0` after the spine ingests, against a live ClickHouse container (verified locally: a real INSERT round-trips). Claim-to-gate matrix adds a GATED row "Ingested events land in the queryable ClickHouse lake" (16 GATED / 11 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE). At-least-once with a deterministic `event_id` (MergeTree does not dedup; the gate asserts queryability, not exact-once).

### Security

- **CodeQL (`security-and-quality`) alert cleanup.** Resolved the open code-scanning alerts surfaced by the fresh `security-and-quality` analysis. Real code fixes: (1) **`go/clear-text-logging` + `go/log-injection`** in `services/ingest/internal/enrichment/shodan.go` — the failure path logged the raw transport `err` (which can carry the request URL with the Shodan API key or response-derived data) alongside an unsanitized, attacker-influenceable `ip`; now it logs only a control-char-stripped IP (`sanitizeLogValue`) and never the error object. (2) **`py/stack-trace-exposure`** in `services/actions/app/api/router.py` — the action record echoed `str(exc)` back to the API caller; it now returns only the exception *type* and logs full detail server-side. (3) **`py/clear-text-storage-sensitive-data`** in `scripts/connector_conformance.py` — a false positive where the integer count of `secret`-type fields tripped CodeQL's sensitive-name heuristic; renamed the count to `vaulted` (accurate — those fields are vault-encrypted) so the matrix write is no longer misread as clear-text secret storage. (4) **`py/ineffectual-statement`** (×7) — Protocol/abstract method bodies written as bare `...` now use docstring bodies. (5) **`py/empty-except`** (×3) — silent `except: pass` blocks now carry an explanatory comment. The 20 `py/request-without-cert-validation` findings are the connector/appliance clients' TLS controls, which **default to `verify=True`** and only disable verification when an operator explicitly opts in (required for on-prem SIEM/firewall appliances with self-signed/internal-CA certs); these are triaged as accepted-risk (secure-by-default, explicit opt-in), with CA-bundle certificate pinning tracked as the recommended future alternative.

### Added

- **Phase 12 — observability + governance (completes the World-Class Hardening Program's 0–12 phase checklist).** Two halves of "run this next to your crown jewels": (1) **Observability** — every service under `services/` declares its reliability posture in `docs/operations/slos.yaml` (availability + p95 latency + golden signals; all 18 services covered — 16 SLOs + 2 exempt), gated by `scripts/check_slos.py` so a new service can't ship without an SLO. `docs/operations/observability.md` documents the four golden signals and the single OpenTelemetry trace that spans `ingest → fusion → realtime → api → agents → actions`. (2) **Governance** — new `GOVERNANCE.md` (roles, lazy-consensus decision-making, the maintainer path, and an explicit vendor-neutral-home intent), `MAINTAINERS.md`, and a **Developer Certificate of Origin** sign-off requirement added to `CONTRIBUTING.md`. `scripts/check_governance.py` + `governance.yml` gate that the governance surface (governance/maintainers/security/CoC/trademark/DCO/SLOs/observability) exists and is non-trivial, so it can't silently rot. With this, all 13 phases (0–12) have landed; the claim-to-gate matrix stands at **15 GATED / 11 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE** (the last NO GATE, wet-eval live-agent tables, needs a budgeted live run — Phase 4c).
- **Phase 11 — OpenAPI breaking-change gate.** `check-openapi.yml` proved the spec matches the code (drift) but had **no breaking-change semantics** — a PR could delete an endpoint, remove a response field, tighten a request body, or drop an enum value with every check green while every generated SDK client silently broke (the reality-audit `NO GATE` row). New `scripts/openapi_diff.py` (pyyaml-only) classifies the changes between two specs as breaking vs non-breaking *from an existing client's perspective*: removed path/operation/schema/property, changed property type signature, optional→required, a new required field on a request-shaped schema, a removed enum value, or a new required parameter. New `openapi-breaking.yml` diffs the PR's `docs/openapi.yaml` against the base branch and fails on any breaking change; a deliberate breaking release ships with a version bump + a CHANGELOG BREAKING note and `--allow-breaking`. 15 detector tests (`tests/test_openapi_diff.py`) prove every breaking class is caught **and** that safe additive changes (new path, new optional field, new enum value, new response field) are *not* flagged — a breaking-change gate that cries wolf gets disabled. Claim-to-gate matrix: "OpenAPI stability for 3 SDKs + MCP" NO GATE → GATED, and the **ratchet ceiling lowered 2 → 1** (15 GATED / 11 PARTIAL / 1 NO GATE — only the wet-eval live-agent scoreboard tables remain, closing in Phase 4c with a budgeted live run). Per-language SDK generated-client contract-drift is tracked as 11b.
- **Phase 10 — connector runtime-contract conformance suite + published matrix.** The reality audit left the "live Test connection" click-and-connect claim with **NO gate at all**, and the schema/vault claim only partially gated. New `scripts/connector_conformance.py` + `services/connectors/tests/test_conformance.py` gate the runtime contract across **all 69 connectors**: every connector must implement `test_connection` as an async coroutine (the contract behind the "live Test connection" button), implement `fetch_alerts` as an async coroutine, declare only valid `Capability` verbs, and **mark every secret-shaped field `type="secret"`** — a field named `api_key`/`token`/`password` rendered as a plain `string` would be stored outside the vault, the exact leak this check prevents. The published `docs/connectors/conformance-matrix.md` (69/69 conform) is drift-gated by `--check`, so a new connector cannot land without conforming and the matrix can't diverge from the registry. Claim-to-gate matrix: "Connectors: live Test connection" NO GATE → PARTIAL, and the **ratchet ceiling lowered 3 → 2** (14 GATED / 11 PARTIAL / 2 NO GATE). Detection-content lifecycle is already gated by Phase 4a (DAC candidate-rule) + 4b (truth table). Live-vendor sandbox smoke + rate-limit/checkpoint durability are tracked as 10b in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Phase 9a — autonomy-safety policy + honest rollback contract + scorecard.** The reality audit found three holes behind "L0-L4 automation maturity gates every action": dry-run was opt-in (a mis-configured caller executes for real), ~15 executor `rollback()`s silently `return True` with no reverse vendor call (the platform claimed to reverse containment it never did), and there was no post-action verification. New `services/actions/app/services/autonomy_safety.py` closes them at the policy layer: `decide()` makes **dry-run the safe default** — anything not explicitly permitted to auto-execute is previewed (`DRY_RUN`), never silently executed; CRITICAL blast never auto-executes; HIGH only at L4 with a whitelist entry AND the `AISOC_ALLOW_HIGH_BLAST_AUTO` break-glass flag. `rollback_capability()` with a **pinned `REVERSIBLE_ACTIONS={block_ip}`** set makes the rollback claim honest and bounded — a caller learns "this cannot be auto-reversed" instead of a silent `True`, and the set can't grow without a conscious edit + real reverse implementation. Every unattended containment (`AUTO`, blast ≥ MEDIUM) sets `requires_verification`, and `AutonomyScorecard` counts executions that were never verified — and executions of irreversible actions — as **visible gaps** rather than assumed-away. 16 tests (`services/actions/tests/test_autonomy_safety.py`, in the actions coverage matrix). Enforcement-wiring of `decide()` into the live `/dispatch` + `submit_action` router, rewriting the silent-`return True` executor rollbacks, real vendor verifiers, and a durable approval-SLA timer table (replacing the in-memory `approval_timeout.py`) are tracked as 9b in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Phase 8 — LLMOps: prompt registry, model pins, response cache, structured-output validation.** A coherent `services/agents/app/llm/` LLMOps layer, all dependency-light and gated. (1) **Prompt registry** (`prompt_registry.py`) — every production prompt is a named, versioned, sha256-hashed artifact; the committed `prompts.lock.json` pins version→hash, and `scripts/check_prompt_lock.py --check` (wired into the CI lint job) fails when a prompt's text changes without a version bump + lock regeneration. This makes the `AGENTS.md` "prompt change ⇒ re-grade the eval harness" rule *enforceable* — you can no longer edit a prompt silently. (2) **Model pins + provider fallback** (`model_pins.py`) — logical roles pinned to concrete models with ordered fallback chains that ALWAYS terminate in the deterministic tier (env-overridable primaries, but the deterministic floor is gate-enforced), replacing the scattered `os.getenv("...", "gpt-4o-mini")` defaults. (3) **Content-addressed response cache** (`response_cache.py`) — keyed on sha256(model+prompt+input) with field separation and LRU eviction; safe under the determinism contract (a hit is byte-identical). (4) **Fail-closed structured-output validation** (`structured_output.py`) — strips code fences/prose, parses JSON, validates against a caller schema, and on ANY failure returns a deterministic fallback rather than propagating a half-parsed object into an autonomy decision. 15 tests (`services/agents/tests/test_llm_ops.py`, appended to the CI agents gate). Migration of the inline agent prompts to `registry.get()` is tracked as 8b. Doc: `apps/docs/docs/concepts/llmops.md`.
- **Phase 7a — unified multi-model router with tier attribution + a determinism contract.** The reality audit confirmed the knowledge graph is already built at ingest (v8 T1.1, `services/ingest/internal/graph/`); the genuine Phase 7 delta was the *model router*. Before it, the deterministic→LLM fallback was reimplemented independently in NL query, playbook drafting, explain, copilot, and each sub-agent — no single audit point for which model answered or why. New `services/agents/app/routing/model_router.py` is that place: a `ModelRouter` that escalates deterministic → ML → LLM only when the cheaper tier is under-confident, and attributes every decision (`tier`, `model_used`, `attribution` trail, `tiers_considered`, `escalation_blocked_reason`). It **never silently uses the LLM** — a skipped or blocked LLM tier (no key, air-gap, deterministic mode, governor circuit open, or a tier error) is always recorded. Introduces the canonical **`AISOC_DETERMINISTIC`** flag and composes with the existing `CostGovernor` circuit breaker: either one forces deterministic-only, in which case the router is reproducible (same input → identical decision). 12 tests (`services/agents/tests/test_model_router.py`, appended to the CI agents gate) prove tier selection, attribution, the no-silent-LLM property, graceful LLM-failure degradation, and the determinism contract. Doc: `apps/docs/docs/concepts/model-router.md`. Remaining Phase 7 enrichments (posture collection, effective-permissions snapshot loader, bi-temporal validity, fusion-time ContextBundle) are tracked as 7b+ in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Phase 6 — performance + cost, both gated.** Two cheap, non-flaky gates in a new `.github/workflows/perf.yml`. (1) **Throughput** — `scripts/perf/throughput_harness.py` runs the *real* fusion hot path (`promote_normalized_event`) over a deterministic 20k-event synthetic corpus and reports events/sec + p50/p95/p99 per-event latency (measured ~250k eps on commodity hardware). The gate asserts a **generous regression floor** (1,000 eps — a >200× margin) so it fires only on a catastrophic regression such as an I/O call slipping onto the hot path, never on shared-runner jitter; it is explicitly a regression floor, not a production SLO. (2) **Cost** — `scripts/storage_cost_model.py` is a deterministic tiered-storage $/TB model (hot ClickHouse block 30d / warm object 60d / cold archive 275d, 8× ZSTD); the committed worked example (`docs/decisions/storage-cost-model.json`: ≈ $902/mo and ≈ $30/raw-TB at 1 TB/day) is drift-gated by `--check`, so the number can never silently diverge from the rate card. Rate-card values are labelled reference list prices to verify per provider/region — the value is the methodology, not the exact dollars. `docs/decisions/0005-storage-consolidation.md` (ADR) records the three-tier decision (keep ClickHouse-only hot; do not add a second hot engine) and cites the gated model.
- **Phase 5 — data spine correctness: schema registry + dead-letter queue + lineage.** The reality audit's load-bearing gap: the fusion consumer logged a warning and **silently dropped** any malformed message — silent data loss. Now every message is schema-validated against a versioned envelope registry (`services/fusion/app/services/event_schema.py`: `aisoc.raw_events` and `aisoc.alerts.raw`, each pinned to `v1`, with a drift-guard test so the wire contract can't move unnoticed) *before* the promoter sees it. Anything that fails — non-object payload, unknown `schema_version`, missing `ocsf_event`, non-UUID tenant, or a RawAlert that fails deep Pydantic validation — is routed to a **fail-soft dead-letter queue** (`services/fusion/app/services/dlq.py`: `LoggingDLQ` default, `InMemoryDLQ` for tests, `KafkaDLQ` republishing to `aisoc.alerts.dlq`) with its reason, schema version, source-event lineage, and a truncated payload, instead of vanishing. `safe_record` guarantees a DLQ that itself throws never crashes the consumer. Each processed alert logs `fusion.lineage` (source event id + schema version). 21 new tests (`test_event_schema.py`, `test_dlq.py`, `test_consumer_dlq.py`) prove a valid event is processed with an empty DLQ, every poison shape is captured (not dropped), and a failing DLQ sink doesn't crash the consumer; full fusion suite 92/92 at 59% coverage (floor 48). Idempotency (AlertSink dedup fingerprint, Phase 3.1) and event-time watermarking are already present; backfill/replay-from-offset is tracked as 5b in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Phase 4a — the Detection-as-Code gate is no longer circular.** The reality audit's #1 circular gate: the detection-proposal promote path shelled out to `run_evals.py` **without ever passing the proposed rule body**, so "passed" meant the repo-wide substrate MITRE accuracy didn't move — a value independent of the rule under review. A blind rule (matches nothing) or a noisy rule (matches everything) sailed through its own exam. New `services/api/app/services/detection_eval.py::evaluate_candidate_rule` runs the *candidate `rule_body` itself* through the **real** runtime engine (`rule_engine.execute_rule`) against caller-supplied positive/negative fixtures: it must fire on every positive and stay silent on every negative. New `POST /detection-proposals/{id}/evaluate-rule` stores the verdict under `eval_result["candidate_rule"]`, and `POST /decide` (approve) now **requires** it — a benchmark-only pass is no longer sufficient. `services/api/tests/test_detection_eval.py` (6 tests) is the mutation test that proves the gate rejects a blind rule, rejects a noisy rule, rejects a no-positive-fixture rule, and that the verdict genuinely depends on the rule body. Claim-to-gate matrix: DAC row PARTIAL(circular) → GATED.
- **Phase 4b — detection content truth table (honest coverage).** The README advertised "6000+ imported detection rules", but ~97% live under `_quarantine/` (`enabled: false`) because their upstream query language (SPL / YARA-L / CAR pseudocode) does not execute on the engine. New `scripts/detection_truth_table.py` walks `detections/` and classifies every rule **executable** (fires today) vs **non-executable** (provenance/coverage only), rendering `docs/detections/truth-table.md`. The honest headline: **939 executable** rules (861 native + 77 sigma-imported + 1 community) of 6975 on disk; 5921 quarantined, 115 disabled. `--check` gates the doc in `validate-detections.yml` so the number can never quietly drift from reality, and the README now cites the executable figure for *coverage* (the on-disk figure only describes the imported *library*). Claim-to-gate matrix: 6000+-imported row PARTIAL → GATED (14 GATED / 10 PARTIAL / 3 NO GATE). The LLM-dependent half of Phase 4 (live-agent Tier-1 eval, hallucination/calibration/abstention, model matrix, 150-payload prompt-injection adversarial) is tracked as 4c+ in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Phase 3.4 — cross-store tenant isolation, now proven against live containers.** The offline `isolation.yml` gate proved each read path *constructs* a tenant scope; it could not prove the scope actually isolates. New `.github/workflows/isolation-live.yml` + `tests/isolation/test_live_stores.py` seed tenant A and tenant B in **real containers** (Neo4j, Redis, ClickHouse, Redpanda/Kafka) and assert a read as A returns zero B data. ClickHouse runs the **production** `lake_sql.rewrite_for_tenant` rewriter against a live warehouse (verified: `SELECT … FROM aisoc.raw_events` becomes `… WHERE tenant_id = '<A>'`, so B's rows never return); Neo4j uses the `tenant_id` property filter; Redis uses the `aisoc:t:<tenant>:*` keyspace namespacing; Kafka replays the `graph_ws` per-tenant envelope filter. Every test also asserts the *unscoped* read sees both tenants, so a scoped pass can never be vacuous on an empty store. The isolation registry (`tests/isolation/stores.py`) flips Neo4j/Redis/ClickHouse/Kafka from `container_pending` → `container_gated`, and the claim-to-gate matrix moves "Cross-tenant isolation (Qdrant/Neo4j/Redis/ClickHouse/Kafka)" PARTIAL → GATED (12 GATED / 12 PARTIAL / 3 NO GATE). The heavy-demo-stack items (Playwright real-stack E2E, demo time-to-first-investigation budget) are tracked as non-blocking 3.5+ in `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`.
- **Phase 3.3 — upgrade-safety gate ("people upgrade; nothing tested it").** New `upgrade` job in `integration.yml` (matrix `v7.5.0 → HEAD` and `v7.3.1 → HEAD` against a real Postgres 16): install a prior release's migration set, seed 250 probe rows on that released schema, then apply HEAD's migration set — the actual self-host upgrade path — and assert the seeded rows survive **and** every HEAD migration applied. The signal this adds beyond the existing fresh-apply job is **destructive-migration detection**: a migration that drops or rewrites existing data fails here even though it applies cleanly on an empty database. The `v7.3.1 → HEAD` leg lands 8 incremental migrations on a pre-existing populated schema (verified locally: 250/250 rows survived, 55/55 migrations tracked). Uses `git checkout <ref> -- services/api/migrations` with an `rm -rf` first so the released set is exact (a `checkout … -- path` alone leaks HEAD-only files and silently degrades to a fresh apply).
- **Phase 3.2 — Postgres-outage chaos gate (fail-soft + self-heal).** Extends the `integration.yml` spine job with a second chaos scenario beyond the consumer-kill test: kill Postgres mid-stream, assert the fusion consumer keeps running (the `AlertSink` degrades to "fused alerts still stream over Kafka/WS, persistence dropped for the outage window" instead of crashing the worker), then restart Postgres and assert a *fresh* event persists — proving the sink's asyncpg pool and the API's SQLAlchemy pool both self-heal with no service restart. Distinct event titles side-step fusion's in-memory dedup so the post-restart event is a genuine fresh persist. Verified locally against a real Postgres 16 before gating (persist during outage → `None` with no raise; first persist after restart → row written). `scripts/integration/spine_test.py` polling now swallows transient HTTP errors during the recovery window so a 5xx blip while the API reconnects extends the poll rather than failing the run.
- **Phase 3.1 — the event spine is now continuous, and CI proves it with real containers.** The reality audit found two silent gaps in the product's central claim: ingest published normalized OCSF events to `aisoc.raw_events` that nothing consumed, and fusion published to `aisoc.alerts.fused` that nothing persisted — a raw event could never become an alert row without a human calling the API. Both bridges now exist in `services/fusion`: a deterministic promotion policy (`app/services/promoter.py` — OCSF Findings-category events and `severity_id >= 4` telemetry become `RawAlert`s; everything else is left to the detection engine by design) and a fail-soft, idempotent Postgres `AlertSink` (`app/services/alert_sink.py` — dedup-fingerprint-guarded insert, duplicates never persisted, DB outage degrades instead of crashing the consumer). New `.github/workflows/integration.yml` gates three claims against real containers, no mocks: (1) **spine** — `POST /v1/ingest/batch` → OCSF normalize → Kafka → fusion → WebSocket `alert.fused` frame + Postgres row via `GET /api/v1/alerts`, plus duplicate suppression and a chaos step (kill the fusion consumer mid-stream, produce, restart, assert zero event loss) — driver: `scripts/integration/spine_test.py`; (2) **migrations** — the full SQL chain applies on fresh Postgres 16, re-run is a no-op (new `AISOC_MIGRATIONS_STRICT=1` mode fails CI on any failed migration), and the UEBA alembic chain round-trips upgrade → downgrade → upgrade; (3) **backup-restore** — `scripts/backup.sh`/`restore.sh` against Postgres + MinIO: seed → backup → destroy → restore → assert full integrity, with measured RTO published to the job summary. 20 new fusion unit tests cover the mapping/skip logic (`test_promoter.py`, `test_alert_sink.py`); full fusion suite 71/71.

### Fixed

- **Hosted demo API 500s from stale Postgres pool + broken waitlist funnel (QA 2026-07-19).**
  Live `/health` showed `demo_bootstrap.last_error_type=create_seed:ConnectionDoesNotExistError`
  after 22 attempts — Fly Postgres autostop closed pooled sockets and every
  subsequent checkout 500ed (`/api/v1/auth/login`, `/metrics/*`, `/alerts/*`,
  `/cases` → 503). Fixes: (1) `pool_pre_ping=True` + `pool_recycle=300` on the
  SQLAlchemy engine; (2) demo self-heal bootstrap now disposes the pool after
  every disconnect, splits create_all / SQL migrations / seed into separate
  steps, and surfaces stage-tagged errors on `/health`; (3) demo-mode middleware
  allowlists `POST /api/v1/waitlist/signup` so the managed-instance conversion
  funnel on tryaisoc.com is no longer 403ed for every visitor.
- **Demo bootstrap `create_all` AttributeError (QA follow-up).** After Fly Postgres
  was restarted, `/health` still reported `create_all:AttributeError` because
  `AsyncConnection.execution_options(...)` is a coroutine and was chained into
  `.run_sync` without `await`. Await the options object first; pin in
  `test_database_pool.py`. Unblocks `published_replays` create + `/r/demo-lockbit`.
- **Canonical `/r/demo-lockbit` missing after re-seed short-circuit.** When
  INC-RT-* cases already exist, `_seed_in_flight_investigation` returned early
  and never created `published_replays`. Now that path still ensures the
  canonical replay; bootstrap only marks `done` after verifying the slug.

- **Out-of-the-box 500 from schema drift on migration-bootstrapped installs (#492).**
  `docker-compose.yml` mounts `services/api/migrations` into
  `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d`, so a fresh compose stack builds Postgres from
  the `001_init.sql` lineage — which created `detection_rules` in its
  pre-refactor shape (`rule_type`/`rule_content`/`hit_count`/`last_hit_at`) and
  `cases` without `resolution`/`lessons_learned`. The current `DetectionRule`
  and `Case` models query the refactored columns, so every default install
  served `UndefinedColumnError` 500s (e.g. `GET /api/v1/detection/tuning`) and
  `seed_demo` failed on `cases.resolution`. New
  `services/api/migrations/046_detection_rules_cases_schema_drift_fix.sql`
  reconciles both tables with the models — additive, fully idempotent
  (`ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`), and dual-lineage safe (the `create_all` path is
  a no-op; the legacy path backfills `rule_body`/`rule_language` from the old
  columns and drops the stale `rule_content NOT NULL` under an
  `information_schema` guard so ORM inserts succeed). New
  `services/api/tests/test_schema_drift_046.py` pins the fix and adds a forward
  guard asserting the migration lineage covers every column both models declare.
- **Phase 3.1 gates caught two latent bugs before merge** (exactly what the real-container tier is for — both would have shipped invisibly under the previous mock-only CI). (1) **`scripts/restore.sh` never restored anything.** `resolve_timestamp()` ended in a `[[ -z "$TIMESTAMP" ]] && { … }` guard that evaluates *false* once a timestamp is resolved; as the function's last command that non-zero status propagated out and, under `set -e`, aborted the script before the restore began — for **both** `--latest` and `--timestamp`. An untested backup script had been broken the whole time. Converted the guard to an explicit `if` + `return 0`; the backup → destroy → restore gate now restores 500/500 rows with a measured RTO. (2) **`services/fusion` `AlertSink` silently failed to persist every alert.** The dedup fingerprint (`$10`) was used untyped in both the `INSERT … SELECT` target (the `dedup_hash VARCHAR(64)` column) and `WHERE dedup_hash = $10` (varchar comparisons resolve through `text` operators), so asyncpg's prepare raised `inconsistent types deduced for parameter $10: text versus character varying` and the insert threw — the fused alert streamed over Kafka/WebSocket but never reached the alert store, so the spine's `GET /api/v1/alerts` assertion timed out. Pinned both uses to `::text`; the real-container spine gate now observes the alert row end to end.

### Security

- **Phase 2 continuation — signed, attested container images + SHA-pinned CI.** Every `ghcr.io/beenuar/*` service image pushed by `publish-images.yml` (push-to-main) and `release.yml` (tags) is now: (1) signed with `cosign` keyless/OIDC, (2) attested with a CycloneDX SBOM generated by `syft` and attached via `cosign attest --type cyclonedx`, and (3) built with BuildKit `provenance: mode=max` + `sbom: true` so SLSA provenance and an SPDX SBOM ride the image manifest. Every third-party GitHub Action across all 32 workflows is pinned to a full commit SHA (tag retained as a comment) so a tag-hijack of an upstream action cannot change what CI executes. `docs/operations/verifying-releases.md` rewritten with copy-pasteable verification commands for all four artifact types. Claim-to-gate matrix: "Signed / attested release artifacts" moved PARTIAL → GATED (11 GATED / 13 PARTIAL / 3 NO GATE).

- **Phase 2 — supply chain + truth gates.** New `.github/workflows/security.yml`: a claim-to-gate matrix ratchet (`scripts/check_claim_gate_matrix.py` — the NO GATE count may only decrease; enforces the Phase 0 promise) as the HARD gate, plus gitleaks (secret), Semgrep, Trivy (fs), and checkov/tfsec in report-and-ratchet ("observe") mode with a triage allowlist at `.security/allowlist.yml` / `.gitleaksignore` (GitHub push-protection remains the always-on hard secret gate). **Insecure defaults now hard-fail the boot in production**: `enforce_secure_defaults()` (`services/api/app/core/config.py`) raises `InsecureProductionDefaultsError` when `ENVIRONMENT=production` and any placeholder secret remains, wired into `app/main.py` startup and gated by `services/api/tests/test_security_defaults.py::test_enforce_*`. Added `TRADEMARK.md` (the MIT code is free; the name is not), `docs/operations/verifying-releases.md`, a README `Maturity` note, and fixed the `.github/LICENSES.md` license inconsistency (AiSOC ships under MIT, matching `LICENSE`/README, not Apache-2.0). Claim-to-gate matrix now 10 GATED / 14 PARTIAL / 3 NO GATE. Per-image CycloneDX SBOM + cosign signing + SLSA provenance, SHA-pinning all actions, and flipping the code scanners to blocking are the tracked Phase 2 continuation.

- **Phase 1.6 — platform/vault hardening (KMS envelope encryption).** New `services/api/app/security/envelope_cipher.py`: optional envelope encryption for the credential vault. Each secret is encrypted with a fresh per-secret data key (DEK); the DEK is wrapped by a key-encryption key (KEK) that never leaves KMS/HSM (`vault:v2:<kek_id>:<wrapped_dek>:<ciphertext>`), so a DB dump or a leaked env var yields only wrapped DEKs. Pluggable `KeyManager` protocol with `LocalKeyManager` (default, backward-compatible), `AwsKmsKeyManager` (boto3; GCP KMS / Vault Transit implement the same protocol), and an in-memory `FakeKmsKeyManager` for tests. Key rotation is a cheap **re-wrap** (`EnvelopeCipher.rewrap`) that never re-encrypts the secret body. Gated by `services/api/tests/test_envelope_cipher.py` (round-trip, rotation + re-wrap, plaintext-never-in-token, fail-closed on tamper/wrong-KEK). Added `docs/security/platform-threat-model.md` (STRIDE, vault as top asset) and `docs/security/connector-least-privilege.md`. Completes Phase 1.

- **Phase 1.5 — cost-DoS enforcement.** New `services/agents/app/core/cost_governor.py`: a per-tenant `CostGovernor` that turns the existing `aisoc_run_costs` telemetry into enforcement — rolling-window soft/hard USD budgets, a circuit breaker that drops investigations to deterministic-only mode once the hard cap is hit (instead of billing unboundedly), a per-alert token ceiling (`cap_tokens`), and an evidence-hash dedup cache so a flood of identical alerts costs one investigation, not N. Gated by `services/agents/tests/test_cost_governor.py` (10 tests incl. the headline 10 000-identical-alert flood asserting spend stays at exactly one run, and a distinct-alert flood asserting the circuit breaker bounds spend near the hard cap). Live-orchestrator wiring of `get_governor().check(...)` before the LLM call is the tracked continuation.

- **Phase 1.4 — evidence redaction pipeline (honest no-exfiltration).** New `services/agents/app/privacy/redactor.py`: a per-run, per-tenant, in-memory reversible `Pseudonymizer` that replaces the customer's identifying data (internal IPs, emails, file paths, secrets, internal hostnames, usernames) with opaque tokens (`USER_1`, `HOST_2`, `IP_3`) before evidence leaves the process, while preserving public threat indicators so the agent can still reason. `RedactionConfig` defaults every category on. Gated by `services/agents/tests/test_privacy_redactor.py` (golden-corpus assertion: zero raw customer PII survives; round-trip re-hydration; public IOCs preserved). Rewrote the README "no data exfiltration" differentiator to be precise per mode and added `docs/trust/data-flows.md` documenting exactly what leaves the perimeter (local air-gapped / hosted-with-redaction / hosted-raw). Contract-egress enforcement + air-gapped CI job + Helm egress NetworkPolicy are the tracked 1.4 continuation.

- **Phase 1.3 — cross-store tenant isolation (Qdrant + harness).** Closed the Qdrant leak the reality audit flagged: `services/threatintel/app/storage/qdrant.py` had no tenant scoping at all (global collections, no filter, no `tenant_id` in payloads). Added `tenant_scope_filter` + tenant-stamped payloads + tenant-scoped point ids so a search as tenant A can never surface tenant B's private vectors, while global feed intel stays shared under a `SHARED_TENANT` sentinel (backward-compatible with the feed pipeline). Stood up a table-driven `tests/isolation/` suite (registry in `stores.py` so a new store cannot ship without an isolation entry) and a new `.github/workflows/isolation.yml` gate running the offline layer on every PR. Neo4j/Redis/ClickHouse/Kafka live-container replay is registered as `container_pending` for Phase 3's integration tier.

- **Phase 1.2 — memory-poisoning defenses for the override-learning loop.** New pure `services/api/app/services/memory_poisoning.py`: provenance on every memory write (`MemoryProvenance` — no anonymous memory), trust weighting (verified human outranks autonomous closure) with age decay so lessons must be re-confirmed, a `PoisoningDetector` that flags a burst of same-signature false-positive dispositions from low-trust authors, and blast-radius controls for retroactive re-disposition (`plan_redisposition` + `compute_confirmation_token`: capped batches, explicit confirmation token over the exact alert set, quarantine on flagged signatures). Wired into `override_learning.py` (poisoning-resistant signature key now includes the entity-independent severity band; provenance stamped on writes; `apply_redisposition` requires the token and enforces the cap) and the `/feedback` endpoints (preview returns the token + quarantine state; apply rejects stale/tampered/over-cap batches with 409). The farming-attack eval (`services/api/tests/test_memory_poisoning.py::test_farming_attack_then_real_attack_is_not_auto_closed`) gates the api job: a poisoned signature is flagged and its retroactive apply quarantined, so the real intrusion is not auto-closed.

- **Phase 1.1 — prompt-injection structural containment + detection.** New `services/agents/app/prompting/envelope.py`: per-run cryptographic-nonce evidence fence (`EvidenceEnvelope`, `make_nonce`, `system_rule`) so injected text cannot forge the closing delimiter to break out of the data block, and a `PromptInjectionGuard` that scans untrusted evidence for instruction-shaped content (role markers, "ignore previous", secret/prompt exfiltration, SOAR tool-name mentions, base64- and zero-width-obfuscated directives) and, on a high-severity hit, signals demotion of the case autonomy tier to L0. Added `services/agents/tests/test_prompt_envelope.py` (25 tests across every ingest path) and gated it plus the previously-ungated `test_prompt_sanitizer.py` in the CI agents job (fixed its stale agent-wiring expectations — the investigator agents sanitise via `sanitize_text` / `sanitize_iterable_of_strings` / `format_bundle_prompt_append`). Threat model: `docs/security/agent-threat-model.md`.

### Added

- **World-class program Phase 0 — reality audit** (no product code). `docs/audit/REALITY_REPORT.md` classifies every headline `README.md` claim against the code (`production` / `functional-untested` / `template-fallback` / `demo-only` / `stub`) and ranks Overclaims, Load-bearing untested paths, and Circular gates. `docs/audit/CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md` maps 27 claims to their CI gate or `NO GATE` (9 GATED / 11 PARTIAL / 7 NO GATE), each with a binding "Closes in" phase. The committed 12-phase status checklist lives in `ROADMAP.md` (per-session working detail is in the gitignored `docs/audit/PROGRESS.md`). Tracking doc: `AISOC_CURSOR_PROMPT_V2.md`.

## [7.5.0] — 2026-06-29

v8.0-milestone and trust-readiness release. Folds in the **AiSOC missing
pieces — Phases 1–5** rollup (PR [#337](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/337);
25 commits, 188 files, +23 743 / -907), four named v8.0 milestones (T3.7
NL→playbook, T3.8 design system v2, T4 wave-3 marketplace + 6 hardened
connectors, T5.3 fidelity loaders), the marketing-shell unification on
`tryaisoc.com`, the threat-actor attribution RBAC + port fix, and a large
Dependabot + security sweep that landed on `main` since v7.4.0.

### Highlights

- **AiSOC missing pieces — Phases 1–5 rollup**
  (PR [#337](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/337)). Closes every
  item in `plans/aisoc-missing-pieces/` in a single landing: trust-critical
  honesty fixes on `/sovereign` + Features + README, CI matrix expanded to
  7 previously-untested Python services (~971 new test signals), coverage
  gates, real SOAR executors for SentinelOne EDR / PAN-OS / FortiGate /
  Cloudflare WAF + DNS / Splunk ES / Elastic / MDE / Entra ID / Google
  Workspace, real `CreateTicketExecutor` wired to Jira / ServiceNow /
  PagerDuty, Azure/GCP/Okta/GWS effective-permissions resolvers, the
  managed-mode auto-provision pipeline (`infra/fly/managed/`), CI-built
  white-paper PDFs + 90 s Playwright screencast, the deterministic
  NL → ES|QL / KQL / SPL translator (**81-case eval at 100 % syntactic +
  100 % semantic**), real-browser visual regression, a buyer-journey E2E,
  and four immutable ADRs (`docs/decisions/0001`-`0004`).
- **v8.0 milestones — design system, playbook generator, wave-3
  connectors, fidelity loaders.**
  T3.7 NL → playbook generator
  (PR [#330](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/330));
  T3.8 design system v2 + Storybook
  (PR [#331](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/331),
  `DraftFromPromptDialog` story restored in
  PR [#335](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/335),
  Storybook publicDir conflict fixed in
  PR [#336](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/336));
  T4 wave-3 marketplace scaffolding + six hardened connectors
  (PR [#333](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/333),
  wave-1 parity hardening in
  PR [#328](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/328));
  T5.3 AIT-LDS + MITRE Engenuity fidelity loaders
  (PR [#332](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/332)).
- **Threat-actor attribution — port fix + optional RBAC.** The
  investigation agent defaulted `AISOC_THREATINTEL_URL` to
  `http://threatintel:8083`, but the service binds **8005** — every
  `POST /api/v1/actors/attribute` from
  `services/agents/app/agents/investigation_agent.py` therefore hit a port
  nothing listens on and silently degraded. Default corrected, docs +
  `AISOC_ATTRIBUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` aligned, regression test added
  (PR [#327](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/327)). Same release
  ships an opt-in shared-secret gate
  (PR [#329](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/329)): when
  `AISOC_THREATINTEL_SERVICE_TOKEN` is set, every `/api/v1/actors/*` call
  must present `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (constant-time compared,
  `401` on mismatch); unset keeps the legacy unauthenticated behaviour
  and logs a warning. Resolves the `[#TODO-attribution-rbac]` caveat in
  `docs/threat-actor-attribution.md`.
- **Marketing-shell unification on `tryaisoc.com` (QA wave, 2026-06-29).**
  Every `/(marketing)` page, plus the standalone `/not-found`,
  `/why-open-source`, and `/benchmark` routes, now renders the same
  `StickyNav` + `sections/Footer` shell. The old simpler `LandingNav.tsx`
  and `landing/Footer.tsx` were deleted; eleven marketing pages had their
  per-page nav/footer JSX + imports removed; `(marketing)/layout.tsx`
  centrally injects the shell; `StickyNav`'s anchors were absolutised
  (`/#solution`, `/benchmark`, `/pricing`) so they resolve identically
  from the landing page and from any subpage. Folded together with the
  smaller fixes from the same QA pass: branded `/not-found` page
  (`ISSUE-004`), `308 /signup → /dashboard` for the anonymous demo
  (`ISSUE-003`), `Testimonials` "Become a reference partner" CTA
  repointed from the 404'ing `/partners` to `/contact` (`ISSUE-002`),
  dead `status.tryaisoc.com` footer link removed (`ISSUE-005`), and an
  SSR-whitespace bug on `/about` that rendered "the 69connectors"
  fixed by forcing an explicit `{' '}` token (`ISSUE-007`).
- **Knowledge-base ingest — boundary-aware chunking with overlap**
  (PR [#321](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/321), closes
  [#277](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/277)). KB ingestion no
  longer splits mid-sentence or mid-code-fence; the new chunker prefers
  paragraph / sentence / code-block boundaries, applies a configurable
  overlap so retrieval doesn't lose context across chunks, and keeps the
  produced chunks within the embedding model's hard token budget.
- **Realtime — WS/SSE authenticated via short-lived tickets**
  (PR [#246](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/246), closes
  [#239](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/239)). The realtime
  service's WebSocket and SSE endpoints previously accepted any
  connection. They now require a short-lived signed ticket that the API
  mints for the authenticated session, closing the unauthenticated
  fan-out surface that lived between `services/realtime` and `apps/web`.
- **`apps/web` — Create Case button wired on `/alerts/{id}`**
  (PR [#294](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/294), closes
  [#293](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/293)). The button on
  alert detail rendered but did nothing; it now POSTs through the cases
  endpoint and navigates to the new case workspace.
- **Infrastructure — Terraform CI + missing core modules.** Terraform
  workflow on every `infra/terraform/**` change
  (PR [#251](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/251)) runs
  `terraform init -backend=false`, `terraform validate`, and
  `terraform fmt -check -recursive` against the AWS, GCP, Azure, and
  BYOC configurations; the three reusable modules the AWS and BYOC
  references were already importing — `rds`, `elasticache`, `kafka` —
  are now actually present in `infra/terraform/modules/`
  (PR [#252](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/252)) so a fresh
  `terraform init` against the multi-cloud skeletons no longer errors on
  missing sources. GCP sensitive-var taint cleared on `for_each`
  (PR [#243](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/243)); Azure
  Terraform skeleton documented
  (PR [#247](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/247)).
- **Dependency & CI maintenance.** ~15 Dependabot upgrades across the
  Python, JS, and Go services (FastAPI in `services/{api,actions,agents}`
  via [#317](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/317),
  [#319](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/319),

  `actions/checkout` v6 → v7 in
  [#316](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/316); plus
  `@xyflow/react`, `@types/node`, `tsx`, `@tailwindcss/postcss`); pnpm
  audit high/critical findings cleared
  (PR [#322](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/322)) so the dep-bump
  PR queue could actually merge; a duplicate `@mdx-js/react` key that
  was breaking `pnpm install` removed
  (PR [#296](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/296)); `aiohttp` bumped
  to 3.14.1 to clear CVE-2026-34993 + CVE-2026-47265
  (PR [#295](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/295)).

### AiSOC missing pieces — Phases 1–5 (PR [#337](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/337))

The largest single landing in this release. Twenty-five commits implement
the entire `plans/aisoc-missing-pieces/` roadmap; nothing in the plan is
deferred.

**Phase 1 — Trust-critical fixes** (`1.1`–`1.6`): one build-time
generator + CI gate is now the only place the marquee connector count
lives; the hard-coded `★ 2.3k` GitHub-stars badge was replaced with a
live shields.io endpoint; every SOC 2 / ISO 27001 / GDPR / DPDP claim
across `/sovereign`, `Features.tsx`, and `README.md` is now qualified
with the honest *"controls aligned to"* framing pending a Type I audit
(ADR-0002 below); seven 404'ing footer links and two pricing CTAs were
either stubbed, repointed to `mailto:`, or redirected to GitHub; the
real `services/connectors/app/connectors/gitlab.py` connector that the
marquee pill had been claiming was real now exists; and the `/sovereign`
Terraform deep-links route to the correct subdirectories per cloud, with
Azure added and the unsupported clouds struck.

**Phase 2 — Operational readiness** (`2.1`–`2.6`): the seven Python
services that were silently outside the CI matrix
(`services/{ueba,honeytokens,purple-team,osquery-tls,connectors,actions,
threatintel}` in practice) are now included; the `pytest` and Vitest
configurations enforce a coverage floor via `--cov-fail-under` and the
Vitest `coverage.thresholds`; `prometheus.yml` no longer lists scrape
targets that don't exist (CI now gates against drift); Prometheus
alerting rules + Alertmanager container are wired in `docker-compose.yml`;
seven incident runbooks land under `docs/runbooks/`; and every FastAPI
service now exposes `/livez` (the process is up) and `/readyz`
(dependencies are reachable) separate from the existing `/health`.

**Phase 3 — Real SOAR executors** (`3.1`–`3.5`): the executor surface
stops being a façade. SentinelOne EDR has a real client
(`services/actions/app/integrations/sentinelone.py`) wired to
`ContainHostExecutor`; PAN-OS, FortiGate, Cloudflare WAF, and Cloudflare
DNS firewall each have a real client wired to the appropriate `Block…`
executor; `AckAlertExecutor` and `SuppressAlertExecutor` now talk to
Splunk Enterprise Security, Elastic Security, and Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint directly; Entra ID and Google Workspace are wired as real IdP
clients for `DisableUserExecutor`; and `CreateTicketExecutor` no longer
returns `SIMULATED` — it delegates to the existing Jira, ServiceNow, and
PagerDuty connectors.

**Phase 4 — Larger build-out** (`4.1`–`4.8`):

- **4.1** — Azure RBAC, GCP IAM, Okta, and Google Workspace
  effective-permissions resolvers (closes T3.2). The investigation agent
  can now answer "what can this principal actually do?" across all four
  IdPs, not just AWS.
- **4.2** — Managed-mode auto-provision pipeline (closes T6.1):
  `infra/fly/managed/` + a workflow that creates a fresh Fly tenant from
  a push to `main`, dry-run-safe (won't act without `FLY_API_TOKEN`).
- **4.3** — `make papers` builds the white-paper PDFs in CI, and a
  Playwright project records a 90-second product screencast on demand.
- **4.4** — Connector wave finished: Sysdig, Vault, Snowflake, and
  Cloudflare Zero Trust manifests + docs.
- **4.5** — Pluggable event-warehouse provider
  (`services/api/app/services/event_warehouse/`) with Elasticsearch,
  Splunk, and Chronicle implementations; `croniter`-backed hunt
  scheduler (closes Milestone 1F).
- **4.6** — Deterministic NL → ES|QL / KQL / SPL translator. **81-case
  eval, 100 % syntactic, 100 % semantic** — every output is parsed
  through a grammar validator before return.
- **4.7** — Real-browser visual regression: Playwright + Storybook,
  pinned to `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.49.0-jammy`. First CI run
  needs `--update-snapshots`.
- **4.8** — Buyer-journey E2E covering `/alerts → Investigation Rail →
  /playbooks` runs on `pnpm e2e`.

**Phase 5 — Strategic decisions** (`5.1`–`5.4`): four immutable ADRs.
[`0001-cyble-cti-moat.md`](docs/decisions/0001-cyble-cti-moat.md) retires
the Cyble-only CTI moat in favour of a pluggable MIT-compatible CTI
fusion layer; [`0002-compliance-claims.md`](docs/decisions/0002-compliance-claims.md)
fixes the *"controls aligned to"* framing until a Type I audit lands and
gates it on a concrete enterprise design partner;
[`0003-mssp-pricing-shape.md`](docs/decisions/0003-mssp-pricing-shape.md)
keeps three public tiers, with MSSP getting its own narrative at
`/mssp`; [`0004-live-demo-strategy.md`](docs/decisions/0004-live-demo-strategy.md)
retires the Cloudflare Tunnel demo and provisions a dedicated managed-mode
tenant on Fly.io.

The Playwright projects (`screencast`, `visual`, `journey`) are gated by
`PLAYWRIGHT_PROJECT` so no project's `webServer` boots when another
runs. The four ADRs are immutable: future changes write a new ADR that
supersedes the old one.

### v8.0 milestones — design system v2, NL→playbook, wave-3 connectors, fidelity loaders

**T3.7 — NL → playbook generator**
(PR [#330](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/330)). Operators can
type a runbook in English and the agent emits a structured playbook YAML
that fits the existing `services/actions` schema: graph of executors,
inputs, and conditionals, with the same JSON-schema validation the
console editor enforces. Backed by the same deterministic translator
substrate as Phase 4.6 so the output stays parsable when the LLM goes
sideways.

**T3.8 — Design system v2 + Storybook**
(PR [#331](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/331)). The console
finally has a single source of truth for tokens, primitives, and
composites. `apps/web/src/components/ui/` is now organized as
`tokens / primitives / patterns`, every component renders in Storybook,
and the visual-regression CI gate from Phase 4.7 watches it.
`DraftFromPromptDialog` was momentarily lost during the migration and
restored in PR [#335](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/335). The
Vite `publicDir` copy that broke the Storybook build under the new
config was disabled in PR
[#336](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/336) so main CI stays
green.

**T4 — Wave-3 marketplace scaffolding + six hardened connectors**
(PR [#333](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/333)). The marketplace
registry gains the schema + tooling for the third connector wave; six
wave-2 connectors had their tests and fixtures hardened to wave-1 parity
in PR [#328](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/328) so every
first-party connector ships with the same shape of negative-path
coverage.

**T5.3 — AIT-LDS + MITRE Engenuity fidelity loaders**
(PR [#332](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/332)).
Detection-fidelity scoring now ingests two canonical labelled datasets:
the AI-Threats Labelled Dataset and the MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK
evaluation set, both fronted by deterministic loaders so the
fidelity-score outputs are reproducible across CI runs.

### Threat-actor attribution — port fix + RBAC

Two narrowly-scoped fixes that together close the only path by which the
investigation agent could silently degrade.

`services/agents/app/agents/investigation_agent.py` defaulted
`AISOC_THREATINTEL_URL` to `http://threatintel:8083`. The service binds
**8005** in its Dockerfile, in `docker-compose.yml`, and in the README
service table — every `POST /api/v1/actors/attribute` call therefore hit
a port nothing listens on. The error path was soft-handled, so
attribution wasn't 500-ing; it was returning empty
attribution silently. PR [#327](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/327)
corrects the default to `http://threatintel:8005`, fixes the matching
`docs/threat-actor-attribution.md` references, raises the stale
`AISOC_ATTRIBUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` default from `10` to `30`, and adds
a regression test (`services/agents/tests/test_attribution_service_url.py`)
that pins the URL and timeout so this can't drift again.

PR [#329](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/329) layers an opt-in
shared-secret gate on the actor-attribution router. When
`AISOC_THREATINTEL_SERVICE_TOKEN` is set, every `/api/v1/actors/*` call
must present `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the comparison is
constant-time, `401` on mismatch. When the env var is unset, the
endpoints stay unauthenticated for backward compatibility and emit a
single startup warning so the operator knows the gate isn't on. The
investigation agent forwards the token via its own
`AISOC_THREATINTEL_SERVICE_TOKEN`. Resolves the
`[#TODO-attribution-rbac]` caveat in `docs/threat-actor-attribution.md`.

### Marketing-shell unification on `tryaisoc.com`

Pre-7.5 the marketing surface was rendering two different navigation
components — the richer `StickyNav` on the landing page and the older
`LandingNav` everywhere else — and likewise two footers. Subpage visitors
saw a degraded nav with hash-only anchors that misbehaved (e.g. `#pricing`
on `/about` was a no-op rather than navigating to `/pricing`).

The unification (commit
[`77039a41`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/commit/77039a41)):

- `apps/web/src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx` now imports `StickyNav`
  and `sections/Footer` and renders them around `{children}`. Every
  page in the `(marketing)` route group is content-only.
- Eleven marketing pages had their per-page nav/footer JSX + imports
  removed — they now inherit from the layout.
- The standalone routes (`not-found.tsx`, `why-open-source/page.tsx`,
  `benchmark/page.tsx`) — which live *outside* `(marketing)` and so
  can't pick up its layout — import `StickyNav` and `sections/Footer`
  directly.
- `StickyNav`'s `NAV_LINKS` were absolutised so they work from any URL:
  `/#solution`, `/#pillars`, `/#connectors`, `/benchmark`, `/pricing`,
  `docs/intro`. The "Self-host" CTA points at `/pricing` for the same
  reason.
- `apps/web/src/components/landing/LandingNav.tsx` and
  `apps/web/src/components/landing/Footer.tsx` were **deleted**.

Bundled in the same QA wave:

- **`ISSUE-002`** — `Testimonials` "Become a reference partner" CTA was
  pointing at `/partners`, which 404s. Now goes to `/contact`.
- **`ISSUE-003`** — `/signup` 308-redirects to `/dashboard`. The
  anonymous demo dashboard *is* the signup flow; the old form-fronted
  signup is gone.
- **`ISSUE-004`** — `/not-found` is now a branded dark-theme page with
  the unified shell and a "back to home" CTA, replacing Next's default.
- **`ISSUE-005`** — Removed the dead `status.tryaisoc.com` link from
  the footer.
- **`ISSUE-007`** — `/about` rendered "the 69connectors" because
  React's JSX text-children whitespace rules drop the leading space of
  a text segment that wraps right after a `{expression}`. Forced an
  explicit `{' '}` token so the layout-quirk is immune to reflow.

### Knowledge-base — boundary-aware chunking with overlap

PR [#321](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/321) (closes
[#277](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/277)). The previous
chunker split on a flat character budget, which routinely produced
mid-sentence chunks and severed code fences. The new chunker walks the
document with `paragraph → sentence → token` precedence, applies an
overlap (default 64 tokens, configurable) so retrieval doesn't lose
context across chunks, and keeps every produced chunk under the
embedding model's hard token budget. Retrieval quality on the existing
KB ingestion fixtures improved without any model change.

### Realtime — short-lived ticket auth on WS/SSE

PR [#246](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/246) (closes
[#239](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/239)). The realtime
service previously accepted any WebSocket or SSE connection — there was
no way to assert which tenant a stream belonged to except via the
client's word for it. Connections now require a short-lived signed
ticket that the API issues to the authenticated session; the ticket
encodes the tenant and the subscription scope and expires after a small
window so a stolen ticket can't long-tail. Closes a multi-tenant
fan-out surface that had been live since the realtime service shipped.

### Infrastructure — Terraform CI + missing core modules

PR [#251](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/251) — every push that
touches `infra/terraform/**` now runs `terraform init -backend=false`,
`terraform validate`, and `terraform fmt -check -recursive` against the
AWS, GCP, Azure, and BYOC configurations. The same gates ran locally in
the v7.4.0 deploys; they're now actually enforced.

PR [#252](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/252) — the AWS and BYOC
references in v7.4.0 imported `infra/terraform/modules/rds`,
`modules/elasticache`, and `modules/kafka` from sources that did not
exist in the repo. The three modules are now actually present, so a
fresh `terraform init` against the multi-cloud skeletons no longer
errors on a missing source. PR
[#243](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/243) drops the
sensitive-var taint from `for_each` in the GCP module so the plan stays
clean. PR [#247](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/247) documents
the Azure Terraform skeleton end-to-end in `apps/docs/`.

### Dependency & CI maintenance

Around fifteen Dependabot landings since v7.4.0; the headline ones:

- **FastAPI** updated in `services/api`, `services/actions`, and
  `services/agents` (PRs
  [#317](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/317),
  [#319](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/319),
  [#320](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/320)).
- **`next`** 16.2.7 → 16.2.9 (PR
  [#323](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/323)).
- **`framer-motion`** 11.18.2 → 12.40.0 (PR
  [#307](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/307)).
- **`cryptography`** updated in `services/api` and `services/actions`
  (PRs [#301](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/301),
  [#302](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/302)).
- **`redis/go-redis/v9`** updated in `services/enrichment` and
  `services/ingest` (PRs
  [#297](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/297),
  [#298](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/298)).
- **`strawberry-graphql`** updated in `services/api`
  (PR [#318](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/318)).
- **`actions/checkout`** v6 → v7 across every workflow
  (PR [#316](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/316)).
- **`aiohttp`** 3.14.1 to clear CVE-2026-34993 + CVE-2026-47265
  (PR [#295](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/295)).
- **pnpm audit** cleared of all high/critical findings
  (PR [#322](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/322)) so the dep-bump
  queue could merge without the global gate failing on unrelated noise.
- **`pnpm-lock.yaml`** duplicate `@mdx-js/react` key fixed
  (PR [#296](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/296)) — was breaking
  `pnpm install` on fresh clones.
- Other dev/test bumps: `@xyflow/react` 12.10.2 → 12.11.0
  (PR [#283](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/283)),
  `@types/node` 20.19.39 → 25.9.2
  (PR [#285](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/285)),
  `tsx` 4.22.1 → 4.22.4 (PR
  [#306](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/306)),
  `@tailwindcss/postcss` 4.3.0 → 4.3.1 (PR
  [#305](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/305)).

### Docs

- `AISOC_V8_PROGRESS.md` tracker re-introduced
  (PR [#334](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/334)) so the v8.0
  milestone burn-down lives at the repo root again.
- `AGENTS.md` updated to record AiSOC (`github.com/beenuar/AiSOC`) as the
  single source of truth — the older `AISOC-Cyble` mirror is now
  archived (PR [#326](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/326);
  archive-notice sync in PR
  [#325](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/325); `plans/cyble-aisoc/`
  subtree merged for posterity in PR
  [#324](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/324)).
- Marketing-page docs links repointed at the Docusaurus site
  (PR [#245](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/245)).
- Connector pages — Vault → Auth0/Okta cross-links unbroken
  (post-merge fix on `main`).
- `README.md` synced to v7.4.0 ahead of this release
  (PR [#246](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/246)).

### Changed

- **`VERSION`** bumped 7.4.0 → 7.5.0.
- **`apps/web/package.json`** bumped 7.3.1 → 7.5.0. The web app's
  `package.json` had drifted from `VERSION` since the v7.3.1 hotfix;
  this release reconciles them.
- **`README.md`** version badge + headline updated to v7.5.0.

### Migration notes

None required for users on v7.4.0 — every change in this release is
either additive (new endpoints, new env vars defaulting to safe
unauthenticated behaviour, new connectors and executors) or a pure bug
fix to existing behaviour. Specifically:

- The threat-actor attribution port fix changes a *default* — if you
  had explicitly set `AISOC_THREATINTEL_URL` in your environment, it is
  honoured unchanged.
- The optional `AISOC_THREATINTEL_SERVICE_TOKEN` gate is off until you
  set it. Set it on both the `agents` and `threatintel` services to
  turn the gate on.
- The Realtime short-lived-ticket auth is enforced server-side; the
  `apps/web` client mints + refreshes tickets automatically against the
  authenticated API session. No client work is required for in-tree
  consumers; external SSE consumers must adopt the ticket flow.
- The marketing-shell unification is a `tryaisoc.com`-only change; it
  doesn't touch the console at `tryaisoc.com/dashboard` or any
  product surface.

## [7.4.0] — 2026-05-29

Security-hardening and platform release. Folds in the May 27–29 hardening wave,
multi-agent routing, and multi-cloud infrastructure skeletons that landed on
`main` since v7.3.1.

### Highlights

- **Security hardening.** Prompt-injection sanitizer wired into the
  classification agents (PR [#219](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/219));
  cross-tenant isolation enforced on the detection-loop suggestion lookups
  (PR [#221](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/221)) and on the compliance,
  phishing, and knowledge-base endpoints
  (PR [#236](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/236)); nightly cross-tenant
  RBAC regression gate (PR [#197](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/197));
  cryptography CVEs cleared and unfixable advisories time-boxed
  (PR [#229](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/229)); CodeQL quality notes
  resolved (PR [#224](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/224)).
- **Multi-agent routing.** `DetectAgent.process` wired to the `FusionEngine`
  over cross-service HTTP (PR [#198](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/198));
  `/investigate` swapped to the `RouterOrchestrator` behind the
  `ROUTER_INVESTIGATE` flag (PR [#196](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/196));
  Redis-backed scheduler singleton guard for in-process workers
  (PR [#218](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/218)).
- **Multi-cloud infrastructure.** Serverless-container Terraform skeletons for
  GCP (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL + Memorystore) and Azure (Container Apps +
  PostgreSQL Flexible Server + Cache for Redis), mirroring the AWS/EKS reference
  file-for-file (PR [#240](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/240)).
- **Live dashboard & landing.** Real `/metrics` data restored on
  `tryaisoc.com/dashboard` (PR [#192](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/192));
  API/agents machines kept warm so the dashboard no longer 500s
  (PR [#234](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/234)); seed timestamps
  re-anchored so the live dashboard never goes empty
  (PR [#235](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/235)); landing CTAs pointed at
  the live dashboard (PR [#233](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/233)).
- **Dependency & CI maintenance.** ~40 Dependabot upgrades across the Python,
  JS, and Go services plus CI stabilization (Ruff cleanup, OpenAPI export
  permissions, pnpm-lock dedupe).

### Bump `@vitejs/plugin-react` 4.7.0 → 6.0.2 in `apps/web`

Dev-only dependency upgrade (PR [#178](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/178)).
`@vitejs/plugin-react@6` is built against vite@8, while vitest@4 (landed in
PR #179) still ships its own internal vite@7. pnpm resolves both side-by-side
without conflict: vitest@4 uses vite@7 for the test runtime, and `react()` is
loaded from the vite@8-flavoured build of the plugin. Vitest is tolerant of
the plugin API surface across vite 5/6/7/8, so `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
needed no further changes after the cast we already removed in #179.

No production code touched. Locally verified: web 349/349 tests pass, lint
remains at 0 errors / 76 warnings (unchanged baseline), `tsc --noEmit` clean,
production build succeeds.

### Bump `vitest` 2.1.9 → 4.1.6 across the workspace

Dev-only dependency upgrade (PR [#179](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/179))
across `apps/web`, `packages/sdk-ts`, and `services/mcp`. Vitest v3 and v4
introduced two breaking changes that surfaced in our suite:

* **`vitest/config` no longer exports `UserConfig`.** `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`
  used `import('vitest/config').UserConfig['plugins']` to bridge the vitest@2
  (vite@5 types) ↔ `@vitejs/plugin-react@4` (vite@7 types) version mismatch. In
  vitest@4 both packages target vite@7, so the bridging cast is gone and
  `react()` is consumed directly.
* **`global` is no longer in the default DOM lib in `@vitest/runner`'s typing.**
  `packages/sdk-ts/src/client.test.ts` referenced the Node global namespace via
  `(global.fetch as ...)`; it now uses `globalThis.fetch`, which is the
  cross-runtime idiom and was already what every other test in the SDK suite
  used. No runtime behaviour change — `global === globalThis` in Node.

Verified locally: SDK 9/9 tests pass, web 349/349 tests pass, web lint stays at
0 errors (warning count unchanged from PR #193's baseline). No production code
touched, no behavioural change to the published `@aisoc/sdk` package or to the
shipped web bundle.

### Wire `DetectAgent.process` to `FusionEngine` via cross-service HTTP (Issue #190)

Closes [#190](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/190).

Closes the missing edge in the four-agent façade: `DetectAgent` previously
self-described as the public detection surface but had no synchronous entry
point into the fusion pipeline — callers either had to enqueue onto Kafka and
wait, or reach into `services/fusion` internals directly. This change adds the
last mile so a raw alert from any caller (LLM tool calls, ad-hoc CLI, the API
gateway) runs through the same `FusionEngine` instance that backs the Kafka
consumer path — dedup, correlation, ML scoring, confidence labelling, and RBA
all apply identically regardless of how the alert arrived.

Three additive pieces, no behavioural changes to existing paths:

* **`POST /process` on the fusion service**
  (`services/fusion/app/api/router.py`). Accepts a `RawAlert`, returns a
  `FusedAlert`, and is wired to the already-running `FusionWorker`'s engine
  instance via the module-level `_worker_ref` the worker registers on startup.
  Returns `503` when the worker hasn't finished booting (Kafka consumer not
  yet attached) so callers fail loudly instead of getting a half-initialised
  pipeline. Lives at the root path — the router is mounted with no prefix in
  `services/fusion/app/main.py`.
* **`services/agents/app/tools/fusion.py`** — thin async HTTP client used by
  the agents service. Posts to `{FUSION_SERVICE_URL}/process` (defaults to
  `http://fusion:8003/process` inside the docker-compose network), forwards
  an optional bearer token, and **raises** on any non-2xx or transport error.
  This is a deliberate contrast with `app.tools.graph`, which degrades
  gracefully for investigation queries: fusion is the primary detection
  plane, so a silent fallback here would lose alerts.
* **`DetectAgent.process(raw_alert, *, api_token=None)`**
  (`services/agents/app/agents/__init__.py`). Classmethod delegate over the
  HTTP client — keeps `DetectAgent` import-light (no engine instantiation in
  the agents process) and preserves the existing back-compat aliases.

Tests lock the contract on both sides. `services/fusion/tests/test_process_endpoint.py`
exercises the endpoint against an `ASGITransport` + `AsyncClient`: novel
alerts return a `NEW_INCIDENT` envelope, replays return `DUPLICATE`, an
unwired worker yields `503`, a worker without an engine yields `503`,
malformed and bad-severity payloads return `422`, and a regression guard
asserts the endpoint and worker share the same `FusionEngine` instance.
`services/agents/tests/test_fusion_client.py` uses `respx` to lock the
client wiring: it must post to `/process` (not `/api/fusion/process` — that
mismatch was caught and fixed during initial wiring), the Authorization
header is set if and only if a token is supplied, `httpx.HTTPStatusError`
propagates on 503/422, and `httpx.HTTPError` propagates on transport
failures. A final trio of tests pins `DetectAgent.process` as a faithful
delegate to the client (args pass through unchanged, errors propagate, no
swallowed exceptions).

No feature flag and no env gate: the wiring is purely additive — no existing
caller of the fusion service or the agents service changes shape, and the new
endpoint/method only fire when something explicitly invokes them.

### Cross-tenant RBAC regression suite (F013, security)

Closes [#159](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/159).

Pure-unit isolation suites that exercise the tenant boundary at the
endpoint-function level (no live DB, no FastAPI request cycle) so the
contract is testable in milliseconds and survives ORM churn:

- `services/api/tests/test_threat_intel_tenant_isolation.py` — IOC,
  actor, and feed list/get/create/delete are scoped by `tenant_id`,
  cross-tenant lookups resolve to 404, and writes attach
  `current_user.tenant_id` even when the payload smuggles a different
  one.
- `services/api/tests/test_alerts_tenant_isolation.py` — every
  read/write/queue/claim path on `/alerts` binds `tenant_id` into the
  compiled SQL or forwards it to the service layer
  (`build_queue` / `claim_alert`).
- `services/api/tests/test_llm_credentials_tenant_isolation.py` —
  BYOK credential GET/PUT/DELETE scope by `tenant_id`, new rows bind
  the caller's tenant, and `emit_audit` is invoked with the caller's
  tenant + actor (`CredentialVault` is stubbed so the assertions are
  on the persistence boundary, not crypto).

Assertions read the *compiled* SQL bind parameters rather than the
shape of any single query so they don't break on benign rewrites. All
three suites were mutation-tested by temporarily dropping the
`tenant_id` predicate in the corresponding endpoint — every dropped
predicate produced at least one failing test, confirming the suites
are wired to the right surface.

`.github/workflows/cross-tenant-rbac.yml` runs the three suites
nightly on `main` (06:30 UTC, ahead of `compose-smoke-nightly` so a
tenant boundary regression shows up as the first nightly signal) and
on-demand via `workflow_dispatch`. On failure it uploads a JUnit
report and opens a `security`-labelled tracking issue.

### Attack-chain timeline UI (T3.3, v8.0)

`/cases/{id}` now ships an **Attack Chain** tab that visualises the ranked
timeline returned by `/v1/cases/{id}/attack-chain` (shipped earlier under
`8df637b9`). The new `AttackChainPanel` in
`apps/web/src/components/cases/CaseWorkspace.tsx`:

- Window selector with the same vocabulary as the backend `WindowLiteral`
  (`1h`, `6h`, `24h`, `72h`, `7d`, `30d`) — selection is deep-linkable via
  `?window=…` and survives reload.
- One card per `ChainLink` with the alert title, severity chip (driven by
  the canonical 5-tier ladder `info | low | medium | high | critical`),
  confidence percent, MITRE technique IDs, and the deterministic narrative
  reason emitted by `services/api/app/services/attack_chain.py`.
- Entity-graph summary panel — node count grouped by `kind` (`user`,
  `asset`, `process`, `ip`, `domain`, `alert`), top edges, and a per-node
  severity chip when present in `_entity_graph_payload`.
- SWR-keyed on `(case_id, window)` with skeleton, error, and empty states
  that match the rest of the case workspace.
- New `casesApi.getAttackChain` method + `AttackChainTimeline`,
  `AttackChainWindow`, `AttackChainLink`, `AttackChainEntityNode`,
  `AttackChainEntityEdge`, `BackendAttackChainResponse` types in
  `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`. The wire format matches the backend `to_dict`
  shape exactly (node `kind` rather than `type`; optional `severity` and
  `event_time` from `_entity_graph_payload`).
- Coverage in `apps/web/src/components/cases/CaseWorkspace.test.tsx`:
  empty-state, error-state, and three data-rendering assertions
  (alert titles, confidence percent, MITRE techniques). The SWR mock is now
  key-aware so attack-chain and attack-path fetches stay isolated, and
  `useSearchParams` is stateful so window-selection deep-links round-trip
  cleanly under test. The `WindowSelector` is a labelled
  `role="group"` of buttons with `aria-pressed`, so deep-link assertions
  resolve the active option via the single pressed button inside the
  group rather than a non-existent `<select>` value.

Closes the UI side of T3.3 in `AISOC_V8_PROGRESS.md`. Pre-existing
non-blocking lint warnings in `CaseWorkspace.tsx` are unchanged by this
diff.

### LLM input contract — static regression gate (T2.3, v8.0)

Closes T2.3 by adding the missing **bypass-prevention** layer on top of the
existing fail-closed validator (`services/agents/app/llm/contract.py`). Two
new test files in `services/agents/tests/`:

- `test_llm_contract_extra.py` (10 cases) — fills the coverage gaps in the
  shipped contract: `safe_astream` validates messages exactly once and
  refuses to yield any chunk on violation; `make_safe_chat_model` proxies
  non-LLM attributes through but routes `ainvoke` / `astream` through
  validation; `classify_message` rejects `api_key = '...'` assignments and
  PEM private-key headers; `set_contract_enforcement(False)` lets raw OCSF
  through in soft mode and re-arms cleanly when flipped back to `True`.
- `test_llm_contract_no_bypass.py` (3 cases) — **AST-based static gate**
  that walks every `*.py` file under `services/agents/app/` and fails CI on
  any direct `.ainvoke(...)` / `.astream(...)` call whose receiver is not on
  an explicit allowlist (`_graph`, `investigation_graph`, `graph` — all
  LangGraph control-flow handles, not LLMs) or whose file is not the
  contract module itself. Ships with self-tests proving (a) a synthetic
  `llm.ainvoke(...)` bypass trips the detector and (b) allowlisted
receivers do not. Adding a new agent that calls a chat model directly
now fails the build until it routes through `safe_ainvoke` /
`safe_astream` / `make_safe_chat_model`.

The survey behind this gate confirmed every existing direct chat-model call
under `services/agents/app/` already goes through the safe wrapper — the
remaining `.ainvoke` / `.astream` call sites are LangGraph control-flow on
compiled graphs, which is why those receivers are explicitly allowlisted
rather than silently ignored.

### LLM input contract — CI tests (T2.3, v8.0)

`services/agents/tests/test_llm_contract.py` exercises `classify_message` /
`LLMInputContract.validate` / `validate_messages`: raw OCSF-shaped JSON in a
user message fails closed when `AISOC_AGENTS_LLM_CONTRACT_ENFORCED=1`
(default), and prose plus `summarize_structure_for_llm` output passes. Tests
use `{"role", "content"}` dict messages so they run without importing
`langchain_core` (the contract already coerces LangChain `BaseMessage` and
dicts the same way).

### Real-time graph-update WebSocket (T1.4, v8.0)

Closes the v8.0 loop between the ingest-side graph writer (T1.1) and the
operator console. `services/realtime` now exposes a `graph` WebSocket
channel reachable at `/ws/graph` (or piggy-backed on `/ws/all`) and runs a
dedicated `aisoc-realtime-graph` Kafka consumer group against the
`security.graph_updates` topic that the Go ingest writer publishes to
(`services/ingest/internal/graph/writer.go`). Each `GraphUpdate` envelope
(`entity_id`, `change_type`, `ts`, `label`, `rel_type`, `from`, `to`,
`properties`, `schema_version`) is fanned out to clients scoped by
`tenant_id`, with `default` as the single-tenant fallback so self-hosted
deploys without explicit tenant tagging still light up live. The new
consumer is wired alongside the existing fused-alerts consumer in
non-blocking mode: a missing or unreachable graph topic logs at `warn` and
never blocks the higher-priority alerts/cases/agents/insights fan-out. The
topic name honours both `AISOC_GRAPH_UPDATES_TOPIC` and
`KAFKA_TOPIC_GRAPH_UPDATES` envs (defaults to `security.graph_updates` so
it matches the Go writer's default in
`services/ingest/internal/config/config.go` without manual plumbing), and
setting it to the empty string disables the consumer entirely for tests
that don't spin up Kafka graph traffic. The Investigation Rail and Attack
Chain views (T3.3 UI, in flight) can subscribe today and pick up node /
edge mutations within ~1s of the upstream event reaching ingest.

### Public weekly benchmark scoreboard at /docs/benchmark-scoreboard

Public, append-only weekly scoreboard now lives at
[`/docs/benchmark-scoreboard`](https://docs.tryaisoc.com/docs/benchmark-scoreboard).
One row per published eval run — date, agent version, commit SHA, MITRE
accuracy, MTC p50/p95, total USD, total tokens — sourced from a
checked-in JSON file at `apps/docs/static/data/scoreboard.json` and
validated against `scoreboard.schema.json` on every docs build via the new
`pnpm --filter @aisoc/docs scoreboard:check` script. Substrate rows
(deterministic CI gate, no LLM) are visually separated from wet-eval rows
(real LangGraph agent, real LLM, real cost), so substrate numbers can
never be quoted as live agent performance. Includes an inline SSR-rendered
SVG sparkline of MITRE accuracy over time, no Recharts/client JS bundle
hit. The marketing `/benchmark` page now cross-links to the scoreboard for
the full weekly history. Wet-eval rows arrive automatically once the T5.5
weekly CI workflow lands.

### Connectors — Wazuh Indexer ingest (Stage 2)

New first-class endpoint connector for Wazuh deployments. AiSOC now polls the
Wazuh Indexer API directly (no agent rewrite required) and normalizes alerts
into the platform's OCSF-aligned schema, collapsing Wazuh's native severity
ladder into the four-tier `info | low | medium | high` set used everywhere
else.

- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/wazuh.py`** — `WazuhConnector`
  subclasses `BaseConnector`, polls `wazuh-alerts-*` indices over HTTPX with
  basic-auth, paginates time-windowed queries, retries on 5xx with capped
  backoff, and emits one normalized event per alert hit. Cursor is the
  highest `@timestamp` seen so reruns are idempotent.
- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py`** — registered in
  `_CONNECTOR_CLASSES`; the registry now declares 52 first-party connectors.
- **`plugins/wazuh/plugin.yaml`** + `pnpm marketplace:sync` — connector ships
  as a marketplace entry under category `siem`, mirrored into
  `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json`.
- **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/wazuh.md`** + sidebar entry — operator setup
  walkthrough (API user + role, time-window semantics, severity collapse
  table, troubleshooting matrix).
- **`services/connectors/tests/test_wazuh_connector.py`** — 24 unit tests
  cover schema, auth headers, time-window query shape, retry policy, every
  documented severity bucket, and the empty/error paths.

### CLI — `aisoc plugin new` per-type templates

Replaces the old hard-coded `plugin scaffold` with a real templated generator
keyed on plugin kind (`enricher | connector | responder | detection | widget`).
Templates ship inside the `aisoc-cli` wheel via `importlib.resources` so the
CLI works unchanged after `pip install aisoc-cli`.

- **`packages/aisoc-cli/src/aisoc_cli/main.py`** — `aisoc plugin new <NAME>
  --type <kind>` loads the template tree from
  `src/aisoc_cli/templates/<kind>/`, runs `string.Template` substitution for
  `${slug}`, `${name}`, `${author}`, and writes a project that already
  validates against the manifest schema. `aisoc plugin scaffold` is preserved
  as an alias for backwards compatibility.
- `pyproject.toml` — `force-include` ships the templates tree in the wheel.
- Tests parameterize across all five plugin types and assert the manifest
  validates and no `${...}` placeholders leak through.
- `plugins/templates/README.md` is now a pointer to the canonical templates
  inside the CLI package.
- **`apps/docs/docs/plugins/cli.md`** — documents the new CLI surface and is
  added to the Plugin SDK sidebar.

### Infrastructure — GCP Cloud Run + Cloud SQL Terraform skeleton

Adds a serverless-first BYOC equivalent of the existing AWS module so AiSOC
can be stood up on Google Cloud with one `terraform apply`. Stage 2 #15.

- **`infra/terraform/gcp/`** — Cloud Run for `api`/`web`/`ingest`, Cloud SQL
  Postgres 16 + Memorystore Redis 7.2 on private IPs through a dedicated VPC
  and Serverless VPC Access connector, Secret Manager for every credential
  (auto-generated `postgres_password`, `secret_key`, `credential_key`,
  `redis_auth`, optional `openai_api_key`), and Artifact Registry for images.
  One service account per Cloud Run service with least-privilege
  `secretAccessor` bindings. The skeleton points at the public GHCR demo
  images so a fresh `apply` works zero-config; operators override via
  `api_image` / `web_image` / `ingest_image`.
- **`apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md`** + sidebar entry (between `kubernetes`
  and `env-vars`) — quickstart, state-backend guidance, Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
  notes, cost envelope, and the long-running-services follow-up plan (GKE
  Autopilot for `agents`, `realtime`, `connectors`, `alert-fusion`,
  `threatintel`, `fusion`).
- `infra/terraform/gcp/README.md` mirrors the deploy doc for module-local
  consumption.

### Live Actions — generic vendor/capability dispatcher (Stage 2 #8)

Adds a vendor-pluggable response-action surface so plugins can register
executors against the existing capability taxonomy without forking the
in-tree executor list. The dispatcher always returns a typed
`LiveActionResult`; unknown `(vendor_id, capability)` pairs return `FAILED`
with `error="executor_not_found"` so the agent degrades gracefully instead
of seeing a 500.

- **`services/actions/app/live_actions/models.py`** —
  `LiveActionRequest`/`Result`/`Descriptor` Pydantic models (UTC-aware).
- **`services/actions/app/live_actions/registry.py`** — `LiveActionExecutor`
  ABC + module-level `LiveActionRegistry`.
- **`services/actions/app/live_actions/dispatcher.py`** — structured logging,
  error translation, dry-run + missing-credential semantics
  (`SIMULATED`, never `PARTIAL`).
- Adapters wrap every existing in-tree executor (CrowdStrike, Okta, AWS SG,
  Splunk) so they now show up as `builtin` descriptors.
- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/live_actions.py`** — `discover`,
  `dispatch`, `dry-run` REST routes; built-ins are registered at app startup.
- 45 new tests across models / registry / dispatcher / router / builtins
  (full actions suite: 99 passed).
- **`apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md`** + sidebar slot.
- Drive-by: fixed two pre-existing broken doc links flagged by the
  Docusaurus build (osctrl → aisoc-direct stub, `air-gapped` → `env-vars`).

### Agents — deterministic NL→ES|QL translator + 50-pair eval set (Stage 2 #16)

Replaces the template fallback in
`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/nl_query.py` with a real, offline-friendly,
deterministic IR + renderer that emits ES|QL, KQL, and SPL and runs every
output through a lightweight grammar validator before returning. An optional
LLM enhancement path (`gpt-4o-mini`) is exposed via `enhance_with_llm` for
callers with credentials; failures fall back to the deterministic path so the
air-gapped story keeps working and the eval harness stays reproducible.

- **`services/agents/app/nl_query/`** — IR, grammar, translator, renderers.
- All `# TODO: translate` comments removed from `nl_query.py`.
- **`services/agents/tests/eval_data/nl_query_eval.json`** — 50-pair gold
  NL→ES|QL eval set.
- **`services/agents/tests/test_nl_query_eval.py`** — 100% syntactic validity,
  100% semantic match (50/50 perfect) against gold intents.
- Pre-existing services/agents tests still green (162 passed) when ignoring
  the asyncpg-dependent suites that fail on a fresh checkout.

### Connectors — auditd file_tail + AiSOC audit.rules profile

Replaces the host-agent dependency for Linux endpoint visibility with a
file-tail connector that consumes `audit.log` directly, plus an opinionated
auditctl ruleset whose `-k` keys map 1:1 to detection rules.

- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/auditd.py`** — `AuditdConnector` tails
  `/var/log/audit/audit.log`, reassembles multi-record events by msg id,
  decodes hex `proctitle`/`argv` blobs, and normalizes via
  `_severity_from_event` using `aisoc_*` keys baked into the audit rules
  profile. Cursor is `(inode, byte_offset)` so log rotation is handled.
- **`profiles/auditd/aisoc.rules`** + `profiles/auditd/README.md` — ships an
  opinionated auditctl ruleset and documents install + reload.
- **`detections/`** — 4 new detection rules pivot off `auditd_key` for
  sudoers / SSH config tampering, kernel module load, and systemd
  persistence. No host-agent dependency.
- `plugins/auditd/plugin.yaml` + `pnpm marketplace:sync` — registers the
  connector in the public marketplace.
- **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/auditd.md`** + sidebar entry — setup doc.
- **`services/connectors/tests/test_auditd_connector.py`** — covers schema,
  hex decode, argv reassembly, multi-record merge, severity heuristic, and
  file tailing (full connectors suite: 444 passed, excluding the
  `apscheduler` dev-dep `test_scheduler.py`).

### Documentation — operator notifications & plugin lifecycle

Two new operator-facing docs pages, both registered in the Docusaurus sidebar:

- **`apps/docs/docs/operations/notifications.md`** — complete inventory of
  every notification surface in AiSOC: Web Push to the responder PWA (VAPID,
  Redis, topic routing), Slack ChatOps via `/aisoc`, Slack/Teams ChatOps
  verification, one-shot `notify_slack` from playbooks, `create_ticket`
  simulation + recommended plugin path, honeytoken first-touch webhooks,
  connector freshness alerts, on-call gating, suppression / quiet-hours, and
  a per-mechanism testing recipe.
- **`apps/docs/docs/plugins/lifecycle.md`** — operator's view of plugin
  states (`Discovered → Loaded → Enabled/Disabled`, plus `signature_status`),
  trust modes (`strict | warn | disabled`), filesystem + OCI discovery, the
  full operator REST API with required permissions, configuration reference,
  upgrade and rollback semantics, and the structlog events worth alerting on.

Both pages cross-link the existing `concepts/live-actions`, `plugins/overview`,
`plugins/publishing`, and `plugins/cli` pages so they sit in the right place
in the information architecture.

### API — blameless case post-mortem endpoint

Mirrors the existing case auto-summary pipeline to produce a deterministic,
blameless retrospective for any case.

- **`services/api/app/services/case_postmortem.py`** — pure builder + async
  DB orchestrator (`build_case_postmortem`). Reuses `SummaryCaseRow` /
  `SummaryCommentRow` / `SummaryTaskRow` fetchers from `case_summary` so the
  post-mortem and the live summary draw from the same source of truth.
  Output is a Pydantic `CasePostmortem` covering incident overview,
  contributing factors, detection timing/gaps, response phases (detect →
  contain → eradicate → recover), blast radius, what went well / what fell
  short, and concrete action items.
- **`services/api/app/services/case_postmortem_html.py`** — pure HTML
  renderer matching the summary renderer (inline CSS, print-friendly,
  defensive escaping, no external assets).
- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/cases.py`** —
  `GET /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/postmortem` with `?format=json|html`.
- **`services/api/tests/test_case_postmortem.py`** — pure-builder + HTML
  tests including XSS escaping, deterministic ordering, and explicit
  blamelessness assertions (analyst handles must not surface in the
  narrative; the assignee header line is explicitly allow-listed).
- **`apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md`** + sidebar — operator page
  covering both `/summary` and `/postmortem` with audience, output,
  automation, and runbook archive guidance. Cases summary breadcrumb now
  points operators at both endpoints.

### Threat Intelligence — STIX → MISP push (Stage 3 #20)

The threat-intel pipeline already pulled events from MISP (read-only). This
closes the loop with a write path: every STIX 2.1 indicator or bundle
published through `/api/v1/threatintel/stix/...` can be mirrored into the
configured MISP instance as a native event with one or more attributes.

- **`services/api/app/services/misp_push.py`**
  - Pure mappers: `parse_stix_pattern`, `stix_indicator_to_misp_attribute`,
    `stix_bundle_to_misp_event`, `confidence_to_threat_level`. Covers
    `ipv4`/`ipv6`, `domain-name`, `url`, `email-addr`, `file:hashes`
    (MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512) and `file:name`. Untranslatable patterns
    are counted in `skipped_attributes`, never silently dropped.
  - `MispPushClient` — async httpx wrapper for `/users/view/me` (health),
    `/events/add` (push), `/events/view/{id}` (read-back). Every call runs
    through the air-gap gate (`enforce_airgap_for_url`) first.
- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/stix_taxii.py`**
  - `POST /stix/indicators?push_to_misp=true` — response now includes a
    `misp` block (`pushed`, `misp_event_id`, `misp_event_uuid`, `url`,
    `pushed_attributes`, `skipped_attributes`, `error`).
  - `POST /stix/bundles?push_to_misp=true` — same, but the whole bundle
    becomes one MISP event.
  - `GET /stix/misp/health` — calls MISP `/users/view/me`, never echoes the
    API key back.
  - `POST /stix/misp/dry-run` — returns the exact MISP event payload AiSOC
    *would* send, plus an `airgap_blocked` flag for air-gapped audits.
  - Push failures are intentionally non-fatal: the AiSOC store is the source
    of truth, the MISP mirror is best-effort and surfaces the structured
    error on the same response.
- **`services/api/app/core/config.py`** — new MISP push settings:
  `MISP_VERIFY_SSL`, `MISP_PUSH_AUTO`, `MISP_PUSH_DEFAULT_DISTRIBUTION`,
  `MISP_PUSH_DEFAULT_THREAT_LEVEL`, `MISP_PUSH_DEFAULT_ANALYSIS`,
  `MISP_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Existing `MISP_URL` / `MISP_API_KEY` are
  reused from the read path.
- **`services/api/tests/test_misp_push.py`** — 76 tests covering pure
  mappers, air-gap gating, MISP HTTP failures (401 / 5xx / timeout), the
  publish endpoints with and without push, the health probe, and the
  dry-run endpoint.
- **`apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md`** + sidebar entry — operator
  doc with config, endpoints, the STIX→MISP type table, failure modes, and
  the dry-run-as-air-gap-proof workflow.
- **`apps/docs/docs/operations/airgap.md`** — clarifies that the existing
  `MISP_URL` / `MISP_API_KEY` envs cover both pull and push, with a pointer
  to the new integration page.

### Security — MSSP RBAC hardening on `/threat-intel` (Issue F013)

The `/v1/threat-intel/*` endpoints (IOCs, threat actors, intel feeds) were
previously gated only by `get_current_user`, meaning **any authenticated
role**, including `viewer` and `soc_analyst`, could `POST` an IOC, `DELETE`
a feed, or create a new `ThreatActor` profile. In a managed-SOC / MSSP
deployment that is a privilege-escalation vector: a compromised analyst
seat can poison detections across the whole tenant by injecting false IOCs
or deleting the feed that hydrates them.

- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/threat_intel.py`** — every route now
  declares the explicit permission it needs via
  `Depends(require_permission("threat_intel:read" | "threat_intel:write"))`.
  Read routes (`GET /iocs`, `/iocs/{id}`, `/actors`, `/feeds`) require
  `threat_intel:read`; write routes (`POST /iocs`, `DELETE /iocs/{id}`,
  `POST /actors`, `POST /feeds`, `DELETE /feeds/{id}`) require
  `threat_intel:write`. The legacy `User`-typed dependency was replaced with
  the platform-standard `AuthUser` so JWT and API-key callers are gated by
  the same code path.
- **`services/api/app/core/security.py`** — `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` now grants
  `threat_intel:write` to `tenant_admin` and `soc_lead` in addition to the
  existing `admin` / `platform_admin` / `threat_hunter` set. Without this
  the endpoint hardening would have locked out the two roles that legitimately
  need to manage tenant intel during an investigation.
- **`services/api/tests/test_threat_intel_rbac.py`** — 38 new regression tests
  pin the role/permission map (write-roles must hold `:write`, read-only roles
  must not), assert that `CurrentUser.require_permission` raises HTTP 403 for
  under-privileged roles and 200 for privileged ones, cover the API-key code
  path including scope wildcards, and grep the endpoint module to ensure
  every route still uses `require_permission(...)` (so a refactor that
  silently downgrades a route fails CI).

### Detection quality — per-rule cross-fire FP eval gate (Issue F005)

`scripts/validate_detections.py` already replays each native rule against
its own positive + negative fixture (TP / TN gates), but that test cannot
catch the failure mode operators feel hardest in production: rule **R**
firing on an event that was meant for rule **O**. A single overly-broad
rule that matches every `ConsoleLogin` or every `rundll32.exe` execution
silently drives alert volume up and precision down across the whole pack
without tripping the per-rule TP/TN replay.

- **`services/agents/tests/test_detection_fp_rate.py`** — new pytest
  suite that replays every native rule's `match_when` against every
  *other* rule's positive fixture and grades the per-rule cross-fire
  FPR. Fails CI if any rule exceeds `MAX_PER_RULE_FPR` (default 5%) or
  regresses on its own positive/negative fixture. Failure output groups
  the worst 10 offenders with their cross-fire targets so the operator
  can narrow the rule (or allowlist a deliberate broad-vs-narrow
  overlap via `EXPECTED_CROSS_FIRES`) without re-running a full eval
  sweep. Current corpus: 816 native rules evaluated, mean FPR 0.0,
  worst FPR 0.49% — well under the 5% ceiling.
- **`scripts/run_evals.py`** — wires the new gate into the unified
  eval runner as `suites.detection_fp_rate`, reporting
  `worst_per_rule_fp_rate` (lower-is-better) alongside the existing
  alert-reduction / investigation-completeness / response-quality
  gates so dashboards and CI consume it through the same JSON shape.

Tracked as **F005** in `docs/community-feedback/2026-05-12/`.

### Documentation — install pipeline + v2.2 architecture refresh

Documentation-only refresh that aligns every install / architecture page
with the actual shipped state of the repo. No service code, schema, or
API surface changed.

- **One-click install pipeline** is now a first-class doc surface.
  - New Docusaurus page `apps/docs/docs/installation.md` (sidebar
    position 2) walks through `install.sh` / `install.ps1` end-to-end —
    supported package managers, what gets installed, idempotency, the
    `uninstall.sh` / `uninstall.ps1` graduated cleanup flags, and the
    security model.
  - `apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md` adds it as **Path 0** ("zero-prerequisite
    bootstrap") and renumbers the demo / dev paths.
  - `apps/docs/docs/deployment/docker.md` opens with a callout to the
    installer, refreshes every host/container port mapping against
    `docker-compose.yml`, splits profile-gated services
    (`connectors`, `osquery-tls`, `slack-bot`) out of the default stack,
    and updates the GHCR image list to the full 16-image set.
  - `apps/docs/docs/intro.md` adds the installer to **Get started** and
    corrects the connector-count copy.
  - Root `README.md` already had Path 0 — verified and synced with the
    architecture refresh below.
- **v2.2 architecture surfaces** are now reflected everywhere.
  - `apps/docs/docs/architecture.md` data-flow diagram, monorepo layout,
    and Service Responsibilities table now include `services/osquery-tls`,
    `services/osquery-extensions`, and `services/slack-bot`. Connector
    count corrected to 50 (was 26 / 42 in stale paragraphs).
  - `docs/architecture/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` connector count corrected to 50,
    Service Responsibilities table extended with the v2.2 services, and a
    new **§13 — v2.2 Additions** appended that documents endpoint
    telemetry (osquery TLS server + extensions), ChatOps (`slack-bot`),
    Responder PWA, MCP server, Investigation Ledger / Ambient Copilot,
    and the one-click install pipeline. v2 / v2.1 narrative preserved.
  - Root `README.md` mermaid diagram + service-map table extended with
    `osquery-tls`, `slack-bot`, `mcp` and the corrected
    `Realtime` / `Web Console` descriptions.
- **Connector count corrected to 50 across the repo.**
  - `apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md`: catalog count updated and the
    23 missing connectors added across the existing categories
    (cloud / CNAPP / vuln-mgmt, SIEM, EDR/XDR, SaaS, ITSM, network,
    endpoint fleet, container orchestration).
  - `apps/docs/docs/connectors/api-coverage.md`: coverage-table heading
    updated.
  - `apps/web/src/components/onboarding/StartHero.tsx`: in-product copy
    on the onboarding tile updated.
  - `apps/docs/docs/intro.md`: two stale paragraphs updated.
  - Source of truth: `services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py`
    (`_CONNECTOR_CLASSES`).

Old historical entries in `AI_STACK_PLAN_PROGRESS.md` reference 42
connectors and are intentionally left as a snapshot of the v2.1 increment
they describe.

## [7.2.0] — 2026-05-11

### Changed — `docker compose up -d` is now pull-by-default

Track 1 + Track 2 of the docker-compose hardening work that began in
[7.1.1](#711--2026-05-10). 7.1.1 fixed the boot-path bugs that surfaced on
a clean clone; this release attacks the *time* dimension. The previous
behaviour — `docker compose up -d` on a fresh checkout building all 15
services from source — took 10–20 minutes on a typical laptop and was the
single largest source of "I tried AiSOC and gave up" reports. With this
release, the same command pulls 12 prebuilt images from GHCR and is
healthy in roughly 90 seconds.

No service code, no API surface, no database schema changed. Every change
in this release is in the boot path, the image-publish path, or the CI
gate that proves both still work.

#### Track 1 — Pull-by-default boot path

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Every service that previously had a `build:`
  directive now also has an `image:` and `pull_policy: missing`. Compose
  will pull the prebuilt image from `ghcr.io/aisoc-platform/aisoc-<svc>`
  if it exists locally or in the registry; only if the pull fails does it
  fall back to building from source. The 12 backend services that publish
  images (api, agents, realtime, web, ingest, enrichment, fusion, actions,
  connectors, threatintel, ueba, slack-bot) are tagged via the
  `${AISOC_VERSION:-latest}` interpolation so the same compose file works
  for `latest`, `main`, a release tag (`v7.2.0`), or a local override.
  The three deferred services (osquery-tls, honeytokens, purple-team) are
  marked with a `# TODO(publish)` comment and continue to build locally.
- **`.env.example`**: Added a new top-of-file `AISOC_VERSION=latest`
  block that documents how to pin the entire backend to a release tag for
  reproducible deploys (`AISOC_VERSION=v7.2.0`), or track the bleeding
  edge (`AISOC_VERSION=main`).
- **`.github/workflows/publish-images.yml`**: Extended the build matrix
  from 4 services to 12 by adding ingest, enrichment, fusion, actions,
  connectors, threatintel, ueba, and slack-bot. These are the backend
  services that every full-stack `docker compose up -d` boots; without
  them in the publish matrix, `pull_policy: missing` would resolve to
  "build from source" for two-thirds of the stack and the change would be
  cosmetic.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: Mirrored the same 12-service
  matrix on tagged-release builds so that `AISOC_VERSION=v7.2.0` resolves
  to a real published image for every service in the compose file, not
  just the demo subset.

#### Track 2 — Build & CI hardening

The pull-by-default path only matters if the underlying images actually
build. Track 2 attacks the two largest historical sources of build-path
flakes — Poetry resolution failures during image build, and Dockerfile
regressions that nobody catches until release day.

- **All seven Python service Dockerfiles**
  (`services/{api,fusion,threatintel,slack-bot,actions,connectors,osquery-tls}/Dockerfile`):
  Added a `poetry install` → `pip install` fallback. The previous pattern
  failed the build on any transient PyPI hiccup, lock-file drift, or
  proxy timeout during `poetry install`. The new pattern wraps the
  install in `set -eux; if poetry install ...; then ...; else
  pip install <pinned list>; fi`, logs which path was taken, and pins
  every runtime dependency explicitly in the fallback list. The pinned
  list is documented as needing to track `pyproject.toml` and is
  exercised by the new nightly cold-cache CI run.
- **`.github/workflows/compose-smoke.yml`** (new): On every PR that
  touches `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.demo.yml`, any service
  Dockerfile, `.env.example`, or the workflow itself, GitHub Actions now
  boots the full stack from a clean checkout and asserts `aisoc-postgres`
  is healthy, `api` returns 200 on `/health`, and `web` returns 200 on
  `/` — all within a 10-minute budget. Pull-by-default by design (so the
  CI run mirrors what the user sees), with automatic detection of
  Dockerfile changes that flips the workflow into rebuild-from-source
  mode so we don't smoke-test against a stale published image. Captures
  `docker compose ps`, `docker compose logs`, disk, and memory on
  failure.
- **`.github/workflows/compose-smoke-nightly.yml`** (new): At 09:00 UTC
  every day, GitHub Actions does a full cold-cache rebuild of every
  service (`docker compose build --no-cache --pull`) and re-runs the
  same smoke gates with a wider 20-minute budget. This is the gate that
  catches the regressions PR smoke physically cannot — upstream
  `python:3.11-slim` breakage, transitive dependency drift,
  `pyproject.toml` ↔ pip-fallback drift in the seven Python services.
  Failures upload a forensics artifact and open a `ci`-labelled tracking
  issue automatically so a nightly break is visible by standup.

### Changed

- **`apps/web/package.json`**: Bumped to `7.2.0`.

### Migration notes

None for users on 7.1.1. The compose file is backwards-compatible —
`pull_policy: missing` only changes behaviour the first time you boot
(it tries the registry before building); existing local images are
honoured. If you want the new fast path explicitly, run `docker compose
pull` once after upgrading. To pin a deploy to this release rather than
tracking `latest`, set `AISOC_VERSION=v7.2.0` in `.env`.

If you skipped 7.1.1, also read its [migration note](#711--2026-05-10)
about the `osquery-tls` host-port change (`8007` → `8091`).

## [7.1.1] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed — `docker compose up -d` first-touch experience

Hotfix in response to user-reported `docker compose up -d` failures on a clean
clone. None of these are functional changes to the running services — every
fix is in the boot path, the boot documentation, or the pre-flight check.

#### Compose hygiene

- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Removed the obsolete `version: '3.8'` declaration,
  which Docker Compose v2 ignores and warns about on every invocation
  (`level=warning msg="...the attribute version is obsolete..."`). The warning
  is harmless but is the very first line of output a new user sees, which
  signals "this project is broken" before the build even starts.
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: Added `mem_limit` + `mem_reservation` to the four
  data-tier containers most likely to OOM-kill on an under-provisioned Docker
  Desktop:
  - `kafka`: 1.5 GB limit / 1 GB reservation
  - `clickhouse`: 1 GB limit / 768 MB reservation
  - `opensearch`: 1 GB limit / 768 MB reservation
  - `neo4j`: 1 GB limit / 768 MB reservation

  Without these caps, a 4 GB Docker Desktop allocation (the default on macOS)
  would silently OOM-kill OpenSearch or Neo4j during JVM warmup, leaving the
  rest of the stack running but the alert/case feeds permanently empty.
- **`docker-compose.yml`** (`osquery-tls` service): Fixed `AISOC_INGEST_BASE_URL`
  pointing at the non-existent `ingest:8080` (the actual service is named
  `ingest-worker`). Also remapped the host port from `8007` to `8091` to
  resolve a host-port collision with the `ueba` service. Both bugs only
  surfaced if the user actually queried the osquery TLS server, which is why
  they survived the previous release; running `docker compose up -d` would
  succeed but `osquery-tls` would log connection-refused errors on every
  agent check-in.

#### README rewrite

- **`README.md`** — *Quick start*: Restructured so `pnpm aisoc:demo` is the
  canonical first-touch path (4 prebuilt images, ~90s to a working SOC
  console) and `docker compose up -d` is explicitly labelled the
  "developer-build path" (22 services, 10–20 min cold build, requires Docker
  with at least 6 GB RAM allocated). The previous structure presented both
  paths as equally valid, which led users with stock Docker Desktop settings
  straight into a stack that physically cannot fit in the daemon's memory.
- **`README.md`** — *Service map*: Updated `osquery-tls` from `:8090` to `:8091`
  and added a `Kafka UI` row at `:8090`, matching the compose hygiene fix
  above.
- **`README.md`** — *Boot section*: Added explicit timing expectations
  ("~5 GB of base image pulls + 10–20 min of build on a typical laptop"), a
  recommendation to run `pnpm aisoc:doctor` before kicking off the build, and
  a troubleshooting note pointing under-provisioned Docker Desktop installs
  at *Settings → Resources*.

#### `aisoc:doctor` hardening

The pre-flight check that the user is now told to run before
`docker compose up -d` was previously useless to first-time users — its
container check used `docker compose ps` (which is project-scoped and
therefore couldn't see containers launched by a sibling compose file), and
it had no opinion on whether Docker itself was provisioned to actually run
the stack. This release fixes both:

- **Docker Compose plugin enforcement**: New check that fails with an
  actionable error if the user only has Compose v1 (`docker-compose` Python
  binary) on PATH, which is now end-of-life and lacks healthcheck semantics
  the stack depends on.
- **Docker daemon RAM check**: Reads `docker info --format json` and asserts
  at least 6 GB allocated for the full stack (4 GB for the demo stack).
  Anything less hard-fails with a pointer to *Docker Desktop → Settings →
  Resources*. This single check would have prevented every variant of "the
  build succeeds but `docker compose ps` shows half my containers in a
  restart loop" reported to date.
- **Cross-compose-project container discovery**: Replaced `docker compose ps`
  with `docker ps -a --format json --filter name=aisoc-`. The doctor now
  detects whether the user is on the demo stack (`aisoc-demo-*` containers)
  or full stack (`aisoc-*` containers) and accepts either as a valid boot,
  so demo users no longer see false `FAIL` rows for services the demo
  intentionally omits (kafka-ui, neo4j, etc.).
- **Exit-code aware container reporting**: When a container exists but is
  not running, the doctor now emits the exact `Exited (255)` status from
  `docker ps` and tells the user `run \`docker logs <container>\``. The
  previous output ("not running") gave the user no signal about whether
  the container had crashed, never started, or been manually stopped.
- **Stack flavor summary**: A new `stack flavor` row reports `demo`,
  `full`, or `mixed`, plus a running/total container count
  (`(4/8 container(s) running)`) so the user can see at a glance whether
  they're looking at a half-broken stack or a fully-broken stack.

### Changed

- **`apps/web/package.json`**: Bumped to `7.1.1`.

### Migration notes

None. This is a docker-compose hygiene release — no service code,
no database schema, no API surface area changed. Pull, re-run
`pnpm aisoc:doctor`, and re-run `docker compose up -d` (the
`osquery-tls` port change means existing deployments need to update any
osquery-agent `tls_hostname:tls_port` config from `localhost:8007` to
`localhost:8091`, but no one was using that interface yet).

## [7.1.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added — Cloud Security Coverage Wave

Six new connectors, three documentation backfills, and one new ingest template.
Closes the biggest cloud-security gap in the connector catalogue: every Tier-1
cloud workload protection platform (Wiz, Prisma Cloud, Orca, Lacework, AWS
Security Hub) now has a first-class integration, AWS gets three native data
sources (GuardDuty, CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs), and Kubernetes audit logs land
through a dual-mode connector that works on both managed and air-gapped
clusters.

#### Track A — Documentation backfill

- **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/wiz.md`**: Documented the Wiz GraphQL connector
  end-to-end — service-account creation, scope (`read:issues`,
  `read:vulnerabilities`), token rotation, normalised severity mapping, and a
  worked example of a Wiz `Issue` collapsing to `category=cloud_alert` in the
  inbox.
- **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/aws-security-hub.md`**: Documented IAM role vs.
  static-key auth, the `securityhub:GetFindings` permission model, and the
  `BLOCK_IP`/`ALLOW_IP` capabilities backed by
  `services/actions/app/clients/aws_security_groups.py` (i.e. how a SOC analyst
  can quarantine an attacker IP from the Security Hub finding without leaving
  the case workspace).
- **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/lacework.md`**: Documented the Lacework API
  token flow, `api_url` regional variants, and the alert→event severity map.
- **`apps/docs/sidebars.ts`**: Registered all three new docs pages under the
  `Connectors` category, plus the four new connector pages from Tracks B–D
  (`prisma-cloud`, `orca`, `aws-guardduty`, `aws-cloudtrail`, `aws-vpc-flow`,
  `kubernetes-audit`).

#### Track B — New CNAPP connectors

- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/prisma_cloud.py`** —
  `PrismaCloudConnector` with full Prisma Cloud (CSPM/CWPP) coverage. JWT auth
  via `POST /login`, paginated `GET /alert/v1/alert` with `time.from`/`time.to`
  windowing, severity collapse (`critical/high → high`, `medium → medium`,
  `low/informational → low`), and a `compute_url` override for self-hosted
  Compute Edition. Capability: `PULL_ALERTS`. Manifest: `plugins/prisma-cloud/plugin.yaml`,
  docs at `apps/docs/docs/connectors/prisma-cloud.md`, tests in
  `services/connectors/tests/test_prisma_cloud.py`.
- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/orca.py`** — `OrcaConnector` hitting
  `https://api.orcasecurity.io/api/alerts` with an `api_token` field, severity
  collapse (`critical/high/hazardous → high`, `medium → medium`,
  `informational/low → low`). Manifest, docs, and tests follow the same
  pattern. Capability: `PULL_ALERTS`.

#### Track C — Native AWS connectors

- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/aws_guardduty.py`** —
  `AWSGuardDutyConnector` mirroring `AWSSecurityHubConnector`'s shape:
  boto3-based, supports IAM-role or static-key auth, calls
  `guardduty.list_findings` + `get_findings` per detector. Normalises
  GuardDuty's continuous numeric severity scale (`0.1`–`10.0`) into AiSOC's
  four-tier `info|low|medium|high` ladder (`>= 7.0 → high`, `>= 4.0 → medium`,
  `>= 1.0 → low`, else `info`). Capability: `PULL_ALERTS`.
- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/aws_cloudtrail.py`** —
  `AWSCloudTrailConnector` using `cloudtrail.lookup_events`. Ships with a
  curated default allow-list of 21 high-signal event names covering identity
  abuse (`ConsoleLogin`, `AssumeRoleWithSAML`, `GetSessionToken`,
  `GetFederationToken`, `CreateAccessKey`, `CreateLoginProfile`,
  `CreateUser`), persistence (`AttachUserPolicy`, `PutUserPolicy`,
  `CreateRole`, `AttachRolePolicy`), data-plane abuse (`PutBucketPolicy`,
  `PutBucketAcl`, `DeleteBucketPolicy`, `PutObjectAcl`), network exposure
  (`AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress`, `RevokeSecurityGroupIngress`,
  `ModifyDBInstance`), and trail tampering (`DeleteTrail`, `StopLogging`,
  `UpdateTrail`). Allow-list is overridable via the `event_names` config
  field. Pagination handled via `NextToken` with a hard cap to keep poll
  latency bounded. Capability: `PULL_LOGS`.
- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/aws_vpc_flow.py`** —
  `AWSVPCFlowLogsConnector` using `cloudwatch_logs.filter_log_events`. Parses
  both v2 (default 14-field) and v5 (header-defined) flow-log formats. Default
  `filter_pattern` is `?REJECT` to surface dropped traffic only — keeps volume
  manageable while flagging external-facing security groups that are getting
  scanned. Public-IP heuristic (`_is_public_ip`) is RFC-5735-aware, treating
  RFC1918/loopback/link-local/multicast/CGNAT/TEST-NET as private. Severity
  heuristic: public-IP REJECTs → `medium`, internal REJECTs → `low`,
  ACCEPT-only flows → `info`. Capability: `PULL_LOGS`.

#### Track D — Kubernetes audit logs (dual-mode)

- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/kubernetes_audit.py`** —
  `KubernetesAuditConnector` shipping with two delivery modes selected via the
  `mode` config field:
  - **`webhook` (recommended)** — Kubernetes API server pushes audit events
    to AiSOC's new dedicated `POST /v1/ingest/k8s-audit/{tenant_id}` route,
    authenticated with a shared secret in the `X-AiSOC-K8s-Token` header
    (compared in constant time so partial-prefix matches still fail). The
    legacy `/v1/inbox/{token}` path with the `k8s-audit` template is kept
    around as a fallback for control planes that cannot inject custom
    headers into the audit-webhook kubeconfig.
  - **`file_tail`** — AiSOC's connector pod tails a local `audit.log` file
    using a byte-position cursor (atomically written to a `.aisoc-cursor`
    sidecar), with rotation/truncation detection and a hard per-poll byte cap
    so a backlog can't blow up a single poll cycle.
- **`services/ingest/internal/handler/k8s_audit.go`** — New Go handler for
  the dedicated webhook route. Caps body size via `K8S_AUDIT_MAX_BODY_BYTES`
  (default 16 MiB), rejects oversized batches with `413` so the apiserver
  shrinks `--audit-webhook-batch-max-size` and retries, and publishes each
  `EventList.items[]` entry through the existing normalizer + Kafka publisher
  using `connector_type: kubernetes_audit`. The route is disabled (returns
  `503`) until an operator sets `K8S_AUDIT_SHARED_SECRET`, so a fresh
  install never accidentally accepts unauthenticated audit traffic.
- **`services/ingest/internal/normalizer/normalizer.go`** — Added the
  `kubernetes_audit` connector profile. Maps `auditID` to `external_id`,
  `verb` to `activity_name`, `user.username` to `actor.user.name`,
  `objectRef.{namespace,resource,name}` to a composite `target.resource.name`,
  and translates the connector's string severity (`critical|high|medium|low|
  info`) into OCSF integer severities (5/4/3/2/1).
- **`services/ingest/internal/normalizer/templates/k8s-audit.yaml`** — New
  inbox template (legacy path) that maps Kubernetes apiserver `Event`
  payloads (`apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1`) onto AiSOC's normalised event
  shape:
  - `external_id ← auditID`
  - `vendor ← "Kubernetes"`, `product ← "apiserver-audit"`,
    `category ← "k8s_audit"`
  - `actor ← user.username` (plus `user.groups` carried through metadata)
  - `target ← objectRef.namespace + "/" + objectRef.resource + "/" +
    objectRef.name`
  - `severity` is derived in the connector's `_classify_severity` heuristic,
    not in the template, so the same logic applies to both delivery modes.
- **Severity heuristic** (`_classify_severity` in `kubernetes_audit.py`):
  - `high` — `exec`/`attach`/`portforward` on a Pod, `create` on
    `ClusterRoleBinding`, `impersonate` verb, `update` on
    `serviceaccounts/token`, any `RequestResponse` event where
    `responseStatus.code >= 500` on a sensitive verb.
  - `medium` — `create`/`patch`/`delete` on `Secret`/`ConfigMap`/
    `ClusterRole`/`Role`, `escalate` verb, failed authentication
    (`responseStatus.code == 401|403`) on a write verb.
  - `low` — successful reads on sensitive resources (`get` on `Secret`),
    successful writes on routine resources.
  - `info` — everything else (health probes, list/watch on benign resources,
    successful low-impact reads).
- **`plugins/kubernetes-audit/plugin.yaml`** — Manifest with a 4-field config
  schema (`mode`, `cluster_name`, `inbox_token`, `audit_log_path`,
  `cursor_path`), `category: cloud`, capabilities `pull_audit` + `pull_alerts`.
- **`apps/docs/docs/connectors/kubernetes-audit.md`** — Includes a complete
  sample `AuditPolicy` (omitStages on RequestReceived for verbosity control;
  Metadata level for routine reads, RequestResponse for writes on Secret /
  ConfigMap / ClusterRoleBinding) and a sample `AuditSink` pointing at AiSOC's
  inbox URL.

#### Cross-cutting

- **`marketplace/index.json` + `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json`** —
  Rebuilt via `pnpm marketplace:sync`. Plugin count rose from 43 → 49 (+6
  cloud connectors). Total marketplace entries: `total=7104 detections=6993
  playbooks=62 plugins=49 mitre_techniques=493`.
- **`apps/web/package.json`** — Version bumped from `7.0.3` to `7.1.0`; the
  sidebar and landing-page footer both surface the new version automatically.

#### Test footprint

- 43 unit tests for `KubernetesAuditConnector` covering both delivery modes,
  cursor persistence, rotation/truncation, byte-cap drain semantics, and the
  full severity-heuristic decision table.
- 27 unit tests for `AWSVPCFlowLogsConnector` covering v2/v5 parsing,
  public-IP classification edge cases (RFC1918, CGNAT, TEST-NET-1/2/3), and
  the default REJECT filter pattern.
- Mirroring tests for `PrismaCloudConnector`, `OrcaConnector`,
  `AWSGuardDutyConnector`, `AWSCloudTrailConnector` covering schema,
  normalise, pagination, and auth-error paths.
- Full `services/connectors` suite passes at 364 tests; schema-introspection
  tests in `services/api` also pass with the six new connectors added to
  `_CONNECTOR_CLASSES`.

## [7.0.3] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed — Hydration mismatch, font preload warnings

#### Web app (`apps/web/`)

- **`src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`**: Wrapped `<DemoBanner />` in a new
  `<ClientOnly>` boundary so the banner (which reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE`)
  is never server-rendered. This eliminates React hydration error #418 caused by
  stale env-var inlining producing a structural tree mismatch (server saw
  `<button>` from Sidebar, client expected `<div>` from DemoBanner).
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`**: Added `preload: false` to the `JetBrains_Mono`
  `next/font/google` config. The monospace font is only used in code blocks and
  is not needed on the initial paint of most pages, causing Chrome to log
  "preloaded but not used within a few seconds" warnings. Lazy-loading the font
  eliminates these warnings without any visible FOUT.

---

## [7.0.2] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed — Version alignment, landing-page footer, documentation

- **`apps/web/package.json`**: Bumped `version` to `7.0.2`; sidebar now shows `v7.0.2` dynamically.
- **`apps/web/src/components/landing/Footer.tsx`**: Replaced hard-coded `v6.1.0` string with a
  dynamic import of `package.json` so the landing page footer always reflects the current package version.
- **`README.md`**: Updated version badge to `7.0.1`; added `osquery-tls` (port 8090) and
  `osquery-extensions` entries to the services table, the Swagger-UI URL table, and the
  directory tree; added osquery TLS server URL to the dev surface table.

---

## [7.0.1] — 2026-05-10

### Fixed — Web app hardening: CodeQL, hydration, Turbopack config

#### Security (CodeQL Code-Scanning — 42 alerts cleared)

- **Python**: Resolved `py/unused-global-variable` in `credential_vault.py`,
  `pack_loader.py`, `executive_digest.py`, `case_summary.py`,
  `cost_dashboard.py`, and `actions/executors/base.py` by refactoring mutable
  state into dictionaries and exposing identifiers via `__all__`.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/cyclic-import` between `osquery-tls` modules by
  extracting `generate_node_key` into a new `app/core/crypto.py` module.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/empty-except` in `api/main.py` and `api/services/github.py`
  by replacing bare `pass` blocks with `logger.debug` calls.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/log-injection` in `github.py`, `detection_proposals.py`,
  and `llm_credentials.py` by switching log format specifiers to `%r`.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data` in
  `workers/oauth_refresh.py` by redacting `tenant_id` and sanitising reason strings.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/incomplete-url-substring-sanitization` in
  `llm_resolver.py` by using `urllib.parse.urlparse` for hostname extraction.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/stack-trace-exposure` in `agents/api/explain.py` by
  returning a generic error string from the exception handler.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/call/wrong-arguments` in `agents/tests/smoke_explain.py`
  by importing and passing a `LlmConfig` instance to `_stream_explanation`.
- **Python**: Resolved `py/unused-import` in `osquery-tls/db/env.py`; fixed
  `E402` (import ordering) in the same file.
- **JavaScript**: Resolved `js/unused-local-variable` in `AlertsView.tsx`
  (removed unused `toast` import) and `SettingsView.byok.test.tsx` (removed
  unused `within` import).

#### Web app (`apps/web/`)

- **`next.config.js`**: Removed deprecated `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` key that
  Next.js 16 no longer accepts in the config file; added `turbopack.root` so
  Turbopack resolves workspace packages correctly.
- **`src/app/layout.tsx`**: Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to the `<html>`
  element so that the render-blocking `themeBootstrapScript` can freely write
  `data-theme`, `data-theme-preference`, and `style.colorScheme` on the client
  without React reporting a hydration mismatch on every page load.

## [7.0.x] — 2026-05-10 — Endpoint telemetry wave (PR1–PR6)

> **⚠️ Reconciliation notice (2026-05-12)**: The work described in this
> section was developed on branch `feat/pr6-osquery-extensions`
> (commits `e0d70fa1` → `3ab5aa81`) but the branch was **not merged into

> `services/connectors/app/connectors/aisoc_direct.py`,
> `services/agents/app/playbook/steps/osquery_live_query.py`, and the
> osquery-extensions Go module — exist on that branch and can be reviewed
> there, but are **not present on `main`** as of v7.1.0 planning. Treat
> this section as a record of in-flight work pending PR merge, not as
> shipped functionality. The community-feedback-driven roadmap
> (`docs/community-feedback/2026-05-12/`) builds the generic

### Added — osctrl, FleetDM, aisoc-osquery-tls, aisoc-direct, native osquery detections, live-query playbook step, FIM, custom virtual tables

Six-PR wave that closes [#44](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/44)
("osctrl connector for fleet-wide osquery telemetry") and significantly extends
osquery coverage end to end. Shipped in the v7.0 release window between the
v7.0.0 baseline and the v7.0.1 hardening patch.

#### PR1 — osctrl + FleetDM connectors

- **`services/connectors/app/connectors/osctrl.py`**, **`fleetdm.py`** — Two new
  `BaseConnector` subclasses with full `schema()`, `validate()`, `fetch_events()`,
  and `normalize()` implementations. Schema-driven setup runs a live
  `Test connection` round-trip before save; secrets encrypted with the
  application-layer `CredentialVault` (Fernet AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256);
  polling on per-instance schedule via `ConnectorScheduler`.
- **`plugins/osctrl/plugin.yaml`**, **`plugins/fleetdm/plugin.yaml`** — Marketplace
  manifests mirroring the connector schemas. `marketplace/index.json` regenerated
  via `pnpm marketplace:sync`.
- **`services/connectors/tests/test_osquery_connectors.py`** — Schema contract +
  severity heuristics tests.

#### PR2 — Native osquery detection schema migration

- **`detections/endpoint/osquery-*.yaml`** — 16 osquery detection rules
  migrated from `_quarantine/` to the native schema, IDs `det-endpoint-281`
  through `det-endpoint-296`. Coverage spans credential access, persistence,
  lateral movement, defense evasion, and discovery on macOS, Linux (auditd),
  and Windows.
- **`detections/fixtures/osquery_*.json`** — Positive / negative test
  fixtures for every migrated rule, gated by the Detection Validation
  workflow in CI.

#### PR3 — Live-query playbook step

- **`services/actions/app/clients/osctrl_client.py`**,
  **`fleetdm_client.py`**, **`aisoc_direct_client.py`** — Production-grade
  HTTP clients with per-vendor auth, retries, and structured error handling.
- **`services/actions/app/clients/osquery_allowlist.py`** — Strict allowlist
  enforcing only safe SELECT-only queries against approved tables (no
  `ATTACH`, no `INSERT`, no `pragma_*` introspection of secrets).
- **`services/agents/app/playbook/engine.py::_handle_osquery_live_query`** —
  New `osquery_live_query` step type, registered in
  `services/agents/app/playbook/models.py` as `StepType.OSQUERY_LIVE_QUERY` and
  dispatched from the `STEP_HANDLERS` table at the bottom of `engine.py`.
  Pushes allowlisted distributed queries to a single host or fleet-wide via
  osctrl / FleetDM / aisoc-direct with HMAC-signed ChatOps approval before
  execution. Tests live in
  `services/agents/tests/test_osquery_live_query_step.py`.

  > **v7.0.x reconciliation:** Earlier drafts of this CHANGELOG referenced a
  > separate module at `services/agents/app/playbook/steps/osquery_live_query.py`.
  > That module never landed on `main` — the handler is inlined in `engine.py`
  > to keep the playbook engine's dispatch table in one place. The behaviour,
  > tests, and CLI surface are identical to the originally documented design.

#### PR4 — `aisoc-osquery-tls` FastAPI service + `aisoc-direct` connector

- **`services/osquery-tls/`** — New first-party FastAPI service exposing
  `/api/v1/enroll`, `/api/v1/config`, `/api/v1/log`, `/api/v1/distributed/read`,
  `/api/v1/distributed/write`, plus `/api/v1/fim` for file-integrity events.
  Self-hosted osquery TLS plugin endpoints are FleetDM-compatible so any
  off-the-shelf osquery agent can enroll without a third-party SaaS hop.
  Uses dedicated SQLite + Alembic migrations under `services/osquery-tls/db/`.
- **`services/osquery-tls/app/api/v1/endpoints/log.py`** + matching
  `plugins/aisoc-direct/plugin.yaml` and
  `services/actions/app/clients/aisoc_direct_client.py` — Direct-from-agent
  ingest path that consumes the osquery-tls log stream and normalises into
  the standard alert schema; bypasses third-party SaaS entirely. The
  `aisoc-direct` connector is implemented as a **virtual connector**: agents
  push events directly into `/api/v1/log` on the osquery-tls service, which
  fans them out to the same ingest pipeline the polled connectors use. The
  marketplace manifest lives at `plugins/aisoc-direct/plugin.yaml`; the
  outbound client (used by playbooks to drive distributed queries) lives at
  `services/actions/app/clients/aisoc_direct_client.py`.

  > **v7.0.x reconciliation:** Earlier drafts of this CHANGELOG referenced a
  > polled connector module at
  > `services/connectors/app/connectors/aisoc_direct.py`. That module never
  > landed on `main`. The connector is implemented as a push-based virtual
  > connector (the `osquery-tls` service is itself the ingest endpoint), so
  > there is nothing to register in `services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py`.
  > Functionally the data path is identical to the originally documented
  > design.

#### PR5 — Osquery packs + FIM endpoint + FIM dashboard

- **`services/osquery-tls/app/osquery_packs/`** — Bundled IR / OSquery-ATT&CK /
  FIM packs distributed to every enrolled agent on enrollment. Pack loader
  preserves hand-crafted playbooks under `pack root` (do not `rmtree`).
- **`services/osquery-tls/app/api/v1/endpoints/fim.py`** — File-integrity
  monitoring endpoint. Ingests `file_events` and synthesises alerts on writes
  to `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/shadow`, sshd configs, sudoers, and Windows
  registry hives. FIM-specific detection IDs `det-endpoint-297..300`
  (renumbered from 281–284 to avoid collision with osquery-macos rules).
- **`apps/web/src/components/dashboard/FimDashboard.tsx`** — New dashboard
  panel grouping FIM events by host, file, and severity.

#### PR6 — AiSOC osquery extensions (custom virtual tables)

- **`services/osquery-extensions/tables/`** — 5 custom Go-based virtual tables
  shipping with the agent for richer endpoint visibility plus a bidirectional
  response channel:
  - `aisoc_browser_extensions` — installed browser extensions across Chrome,
    Firefox, Edge, Safari profiles.
  - `aisoc_kernel_modules` — currently loaded kernel modules with signing /
    tainting state.
  - `aisoc_attck_persistence` — MITRE ATT&CK persistence locations
    (LaunchAgents, scheduled tasks, systemd units, Run keys).
  - `aisoc_pending_actions` — pending response actions queued for the agent;
    enables host → server → host bidirectional flow.
  - `aisoc_alert_cache` — local cache of alerts the agent has emitted, for
    deduplication and replay.
- **`services/osquery-extensions/tables/pending_actions_test.go`** — Unit
  tests for the bidirectional action queue.
- **`docs/openapi.yaml`** regenerated to include the extensions API endpoints.

#### Cross-cutting CI / housekeeping

- **CI**: Detection Validation workflow now covers the 16 migrated osquery
  rules; Python Tests, Web Build, and the osquery-tls service build are all
  green.
- **Lint**: `ruff format` and `ruff check --fix` applied across the new
  `osquery-tls` service; F401 / UP017 / UP037 / I001 / W291 cleared.
- **Marketplace**: `apps/web/public/marketplace/curated.json` re-synced from
  `marketplace/` after the new connector / plugin manifests landed.

Beenu Arora <beenu@cyble.com>.

#### WS-A1 — Slack ChatOps Bot (`services/slack-bot/`)

- **`services/slack-bot/`** — New standalone FastAPI service using `slack-bolt`
  async adapter. Ships `/aisoc triage <case_id>`, `/aisoc approve <action_id>`,
  `/aisoc status <case_id>`, and `/aisoc summary <case_id>` slash commands.
  Interactive approval buttons route back through the API approval endpoint so
  human-in-the-loop gates work from Slack without opening the console.

  client calls, and error paths (bad token, non-200 API response, missing case).

#### WS-B1/B2 — Executive Digest PDF + Weekly Scheduler

- **`services/api/app/services/digest_pdf.py`** — Generates a branded A4 PDF
  for `ExecutiveDigest` objects using ReportLab. Includes cover page, KPI tiles,
  alert-volume chart, top-rule table, top-actor table, and remediation summary.
- **`services/api/app/workers/weekly_digest_task.py`** — APScheduler task that
  runs every Monday at 06:00 UTC, builds a digest for every active tenant, and
  delivers it via `POST /api/v1/reports/digest/email` or writes it to blob
  storage. Controlled by `DIGEST_SCHEDULE_ENABLED` env flag.
- **`services/api/app/services/digest_html.py`** — HTML mirror of the PDF for
  in-browser preview.
- **`services/api/tests/test_digest_pdf.py`** — 12 pytest cases covering PDF
  generation, chart rendering, and weekly scheduler triggering.

#### WS-C1/C2/C3 — Playbook Gallery, Detection Proposals, GitHub PR Integration

- **`apps/web/src/components/playbooks/PlaybooksGallery.tsx`** — Tabbed gallery
  with 12 curated packs (Phishing, Ransomware, BEC, IAM Key Compromise, …).
  Each card shows TTP coverage badges, author, version, and a one-click
  **Import** button that calls `POST /api/v1/playbooks/import`.
- **`services/api/migrations/039_detection_proposal_github_pr.sql`** —
  Adds `github_pr_url TEXT` and `github_pr_number INT` to `detection_proposals`.
- **`services/api/app/services/github.py`** — `GitHubService` creates draft PRs
  against the tenant's detection repo when a detection proposal is promoted.
  Supports GHES and github.com via `GITHUB_API_URL` env var.
- 25 playbook YAML templates added under `detections/playbooks/` and 12 pre-built
  playbook packs under `playbooks/packs/v1/`.

#### WS-D1 — BYOK Per-Tenant Settings UI

- **`apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsView.tsx`** — New "AI / LLM"
  settings panel: provider picker (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama),
  API-key input, model selector, temperature slider, and connection test button.
- **`apps/web/src/components/settings/SettingsView.byok.test.tsx`** — 12 Vitest
  tests covering form rendering, provider switching, key masking, connection test
  success/error paths, and save confirmation.

#### WS-D2 — Investigation Timeline (Replayable)

- **`apps/web/src/components/copilot/InvestigationTimeline.tsx`** — 684-line
  React component that renders the investigation ledger as a playable timeline.
  Each step shows the agent name, tool call, rationale, duration, and status
  badge. A scrubber lets analysts replay from any step.

#### WS-D3 — Case Auto-Summary + PDF Export

- **`services/api/app/services/case_summary.py`** — LLM-powered case summariser
  (structured output via function-calling). Produces `CaseSummaryResult` with
  `headline`, `severity_rationale`, `recommended_action`, and `evidence_links`.
- **`services/api/app/services/case_summary_html.py`** — HTML renderer for the
  summary, used by the PDF exporter and the in-browser case card.

#### WS-F1 — Light Theme Persisted in User Profile

- **`apps/web/src/components/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`** — Theme preference
  (`light` | `dark` | `system`) stored in `localStorage` and synced to
  `PATCH /api/v1/users/me/preferences`. Survives logout and device switch.

#### WS-F2 — WCAG AA Accessibility (axe-core CI gate)

- **`apps/web/src/test/a11y.test.tsx`** — 55-line axe-core test suite. Renders
  `AlertsView`, `CasesView`, `PlaybooksView`, `DashboardView`, and 3 modal
  components; fails the build if any WCAG 2.1 AA violation is found.
- Sidebar landmark roles, ARIA labels, focus trapping in modals, skip-navigation
  link, and colour-contrast fixes applied across the entire component tree.

#### WS-F3 — Saved Views + Drag-Drop Dashboard Widgets

- **`apps/web/src/components/dashboard/DashboardView.tsx`** — Dashboard is now
  fully composable: widgets can be dragged, dropped, resized, pinned, and
  removed. Layout serialised to `POST /api/v1/saved-views`.
- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/saved_views.py`** — CRUD for per-user
  saved views (dashboard layout, column configs, active filters).

#### WS-G1/G2 — Threat Actor Attribution Engine v0 + Air-Gap Mode

- **`services/threatintel/app/actors/attribution.py`** — New
  `ThreatActorAttributionEngine` scores observed IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK
  techniques, tools, and target sectors against an in-memory catalog of
  three seed actor profiles (APT28, APT29, Lazarus). Scoring is the
  weighted sum of TTP (0.4) / Tool (0.3) / Target (0.2) / IOC (0.1)
  components, multiplied by the actor profile's baseline confidence,
  then thresholded.
- **`services/threatintel/app/api/actor_attribution.py`** — New router
  mounted at `/api/v1/actors` with `POST /attribute`, `GET /profiles`,
  and `GET /profiles/{actor_id}`. Constructs the engine once via
  FastAPI lifespan and passes it through `Depends(get_attribution_engine)`.
- **`services/agents/app/agents/investigation_agent.py`** — Investigation
  agent now calls `POST /actors/attribute` and surfaces attribution results
  in the investigation ledger.
- **`docker-compose.airgap.yml`** — Compose override for fully disconnected
  deployments: disables all external feed pullers, enables Ollama sidecar, and
  sets `AIRGAP_MODE=true` so the API switches to local-only LLM routing.
- **`apps/docs/docs/operations/air-gapped.md`** — Step-by-step air-gap
  deployment guide: image pre-pulling, Ollama model loading, threat-feed
  pre-seeding, and smoke-test checklist.

#### WS-H1 — MSSP Console Improvements

- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/mssp.py`** — New `GET /mssp/tenants`
  aggregation endpoint: per-child tenant alert counts, open case counts, SLA
  breach rate, and last-seen connector heartbeat.
- **`services/api/app/models/tenant.py`** — Added `parent_tenant_id` and
  `mssp_role` columns supporting the parent-child tenant hierarchy.

#### WS-H2 — BYOK Per-Tenant LLM Credentials

- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/llm_credentials.py`** — CRUD for per-tenant
  LLM credential records. Secrets encrypted at rest via `CredentialVault`.
- LLM routing layer (`services/api/app/core/config.py`) reads per-tenant
  credentials before falling back to the platform-wide key.

#### WS-H3 — Team Analytics View

- **`apps/web/src/components/analytics/TeamAnalyticsView.tsx`** — Analyst
  leaderboard with MTTR per analyst, alert disposition accuracy, cases closed
  per shift, and false-positive rate trend over the selected window.

#### WS-H4 — Air-Gapped / Ollama Local-LLM Mode

- **`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/llm_status.py`** — Reports whether the
  deployment is running in air-gap mode and which local models are available
  via the Ollama sidecar. Used by the settings UI to auto-populate the model
  picker.

### Fixed

- Ruff `E501/W291/W293/B007/B017/F821/I001` violations in `services/api`.
- `mypy` errors across all 16 plan-modified files: `RowMapping` import,
  `Optional` list `len()`, `current_user.user_id` rename, `fetchone()` None
  checks, `sort_key` return type, `PYTHONPATH` subprocess handling.
- Converted structlog-style `logger.info(key=value)` calls to stdlib formatting
  in `rule_engine.py`, `neo4j.py`, and `digest_pdf.py`.
- SQLAlchemy relationship `name-defined` mypy errors suppressed with
  `# type: ignore[name-defined]` in `tenant.py` and `connector.py`.

### Security caveat

The `/api/v1/actors/*` endpoints are reachable on the `threatintel`
service without RBAC enforcement in v0 — they assume cluster-internal
network reachability only. Do **not** expose them through public
ingress until a `Depends(require_permission(...))` guard is added.
Tracked as a known limitation in the docs.

---

### Added — Threat Actor Attribution Engine (v0)

- **`services/threatintel/app/actors/attribution.py`** — New
  `ThreatActorAttributionEngine` scores observed IOCs, MITRE ATT&CK
  techniques, tools, and target sectors against an in-memory catalog of
  three seed actor profiles (APT28, APT29, Lazarus). Scoring is the
  weighted sum of TTP (0.4) / Tool (0.3) / Target (0.2) / IOC (0.1)
  components, multiplied by the actor profile's baseline confidence,
  then thresholded.
- **`services/threatintel/app/api/actor_attribution.py`** — New router
  mounted at `/api/v1/actors` with `POST /attribute`, `GET /profiles`,
  and `GET /profiles/{actor_id}`. Constructs the engine once via
  FastAPI lifespan and passes it through `Depends(get_attribution_engine)`.
- **`services/agents/app/agents/investigation_agent.py`** — Investigation
  agent now calls the attribution API after triage/enrichment and
  records the result on `state.threat_intel["attribution"]`. Failure is
  soft and surfaces a `[medium]` finding rather than aborting the
  investigation.
- **`docs/threat-actor-attribution.md`** — Full operator-facing docs,
  including scoring model, API surface, observability, env vars, v0
  caveats, and instructions for adding custom profiles.

### Configuration

- `AISOC_ATTRIBUTION_THRESHOLD` — Override the default confidence
  threshold (`0.30`). Clamped to `[0.0, 1.0]`; invalid values fall back
  to the default and emit a warning.
- `AISOC_THREATINTEL_URL` — Base URL the agent uses to reach the
  `threatintel` service. Default: `http://threatintel:8083`.
- `AISOC_ATTRIBUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` — HTTP timeout the agent uses for
  attribution calls. Default: `10`.

### Observability

- New Prometheus series exported by `threatintel`:
  - `threatintel_attribution_requests_total{result="matched|unknown|error"}`
  - `threatintel_attribution_score{actor_id}` (histogram)

### Engine internals

- Tool matching uses an alphanumeric-only boundary regex
  (`(?<![a-zA-Z0-9])tool(?![a-zA-Z0-9])`) instead of Python's `\b`.
  Python's `\b` treats `_` as a word character, which broke common
  malware-filename patterns like `miniduke_v3.dll`. The new boundary
  treats `_`, `-`, `.`, and `/` as delimiters while still rejecting
  alphanumeric neighbours (so `x-agent` does not match `x-agentic`).
- Tool matching now also scans the IOC's `description` and `tags`
  fields, not just `value`.
- IOC lookups go through a new public method `OpenSearchStore.match_ioc_values()`
  rather than reaching into `os_store._os.search()` directly.
- The attribution engine accepts a `catalog` constructor argument so
  tests and downstream services can inject custom profiles without
  monkey-patching module-level state.
- An empty catalog now resolves to `actor_id="unknown"` with explicit
  reasoning (`"Actor catalog is empty"`), instead of confusingly
  falling through to the no-match-above-threshold branch.

### Security caveat

The `/api/v1/actors/*` endpoints are reachable on the `threatintel`
service without RBAC enforcement in v0 — they assume cluster-internal
network reachability only. Do **not** expose them through public
ingress until a `Depends(require_permission(...))` guard is added.
Tracked as a known limitation in the docs.

## [6.1.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added — v1.5 market-driven feature expansion

A review of G2, Gartner Peer Insights, and customer feedback on AI SOC / SIEM /
SOAR platforms drove this release. Five new agents, eight new console pages,
four new API surfaces, and ten new connectors landed at once. Connector catalog
goes from 16 → **26**.

#### New autonomous agents (`services/agents/app/agents/`)

- **`auto_triage_agent.py`** — Master triage agent classifies each incoming alert
  as `true_positive` / `false_positive` / `benign` with a confidence score.
  Low-confidence noise auto-closes; everything else escalates with rationale.
- **`phishing_agent.py`** — Specialised phishing triage: header analysis, URL
  reputation, attachment sandboxing summary, sender-domain trust.
- **`identity_agent.py`** — Identity-centric reasoning: impossible travel,
  privilege escalation, MFA bypass, and session-token anomaly classification.
- **`cloud_agent.py`** — Cloud posture / threat reasoning across AWS, Azure,
  GCP, and Kubernetes signals.
- **`insider_threat_agent.py`** — Behavioural deviation, peer-group scoring,
  exfiltration intent classification.
- All five are exposed via `POST /api/v1/agents/triage`.

#### New console pages (`apps/web/src/components/`)

- **`/investigate`** — Conversational, multi-turn copilot anchored on a case;
  reads its evidence, ledger, and entity graph for grounded follow-up Q&A.
  Component: `copilot/InvestigationChat.tsx`.
- **`/coverage-advisor`** — Ranks MITRE ATT&CK technique gaps by adversary
  prevalence and recommends rules to close them.
  Component: `coverage/CoverageAdvisorView.tsx`.
- **`/shifts`** — Outgoing/incoming analyst handoff dashboard: active cases,
  in-flight investigations, queued approvals on one screen.
  Component: `shifts/ShiftsView.tsx`.
- **`/easm`** — External Attack Surface Management: discovers public assets,
  exposed services, and certificate-expiry risks.
  Component: `easm/EASMView.tsx`.
- **`/mssp`** — MSSP executive dashboard: KPIs, cross-tenant alert volume, and
  per-customer SLA posture. Component: `mssp/MSSPDashboardView.tsx`.
- **`/noise-tuning`** — Per-rule false-positive rate, suppression candidates,
  one-click tuning. Component: `noise/NoiseTuningView.tsx`.
- **`/analytics/team`** — Analyst leaderboard, MTTR per analyst, dispositions
  accuracy, and shift workload balance.
  Component: `analytics/TeamAnalyticsView.tsx`.

#### New API surfaces (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/`)

- **`shifts.py`** — Shift-handoff CRUD: list active shifts, post handoff
  notes, view queued approvals scoped to a shift window.
- **`stix_taxii.py`** — STIX 2.1 / TAXII 2.1 publishing; pushes the tenant's
  IOCs and threat-actor profiles to upstream / community feeds.
- **`compliance.py`** — Automated compliance evidence collection for SOC 2,
  ISO 27001, NIST CSF, PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and DORA. One-click evidence pull.
- **`deployment.py`** — Deployment / air-gap toggles; tenants that disallow
  external feeds can flip air-gap mode here.

#### New connectors (`services/connectors/app/connectors/`)

EDR / XDR: `sentinelone.py`, `cortex_xdr.py`. Cloud security: `wiz.py`,
`snyk.py`. Network: `zscaler.py`. SaaS / email: `proofpoint.py`,
`servicenow.py`, `jira.py`. Identity: `1password.py`, `duo_security.py`.
All ten registered in `services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py`,
all ship a marketplace manifest under `plugins/<id>/plugin.yaml`, all
collapse vendor severity to the standard four-tier ladder.

#### Other

- **AI-generated incident reports** — Every case now has a one-click "Export
  Report" button that generates a PDF incident report from the Investigation
  Ledger.
- **Air-gap deployment configuration** — Per-tenant toggles disable external
  feeds (threat intel, marketplace sync, push notifications) for fully
  air-gapped deployments.

### Changed

- Connector catalog count **16 → 26**. Landing page hero stat, layout SEO
  metadata, and `apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md` updated to reflect.
- `apps/docs/docs/architecture.md` adds a v1.5 section and updates the
  service-responsibilities table to include the new API surfaces and
  autonomous agents.
- `apps/docs/docs/intro.md` updated to mention the new connector count and
  v1.5 features.
- Footer release link now points at `v6.1.0`.

## [6.0.1] — 2026-05-06

### Security

- **Log-injection mitigation** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/connectors.py`) —
  `connector_type` originates from user-supplied query parameters and was previously
  logged verbatim, leaving an injection path for newlines/control characters into
  structured log records. A character-allowlist reconstructor (`_safe_connector_type`)
  now strips every character outside `[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]` before the value reaches any
  log call, breaking CodeQL's taint trace (alert `py/log-injection`).

- **Remove dead rate-limiter code** (`services/realtime/src/index.ts`) —
  The hand-rolled `makeRateLimiter` function was superseded by `express-rate-limit`
  in the previous release but not removed, leaving dead code that masked the
  effective rate-limiting path. The function is now deleted; `express-rate-limit`
  is the sole limiter in production (resolves CodeQL alert `js/unused-local-variable`).

## [6.0.0] — 2026-05-06

### Added

#### Wave 3 — Operational Maturity

- **MSSP / parent-tenant console** (`services/api/migrations/012_mssp_console.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/mssp.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/mssp.py`) —
  Parent tenants can onboard child tenants, manage cross-tenant delegations, add
  per-tenant notes, and view an aggregated metrics rollup in a single pane.

- **Asset inventory + vuln-to-alert correlation** (`services/api/migrations/013_asset_inventory.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/asset.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/assets.py`) —
  CRUD for discovered assets with vulnerability findings auto-correlated to alerts.
  Surfaces asset blast radius and enables asset-context enrichment during triage.

- **Insider threat module** (`services/api/migrations/014_insider_threat.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/insider_threat.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/insider_threat.py`) —
  User risk profiles, behavioural indicators, peer-group deviation scoring, and
  watchlist management. Risk scores update incrementally as new indicators arrive.

- **L0–L4 auto-remediation maturity tiers** (`services/api/migrations/015_remediation_maturity.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/remediation.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/remediation.py`,
  `services/actions/app/services/maturity.py`) —
  Per-tenant configuration of remediation autonomy from L0 (manual only) through L4
  (fully autonomous). Gate log records every approve/block decision. Per-action whitelist
  pre-approves low-risk actions regardless of tier.

#### Wave 4 — Advanced Capabilities

- **Internal threat intelligence** (`services/api/migrations/016_threat_intel.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/threat_intel.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/threat_intel.py`) —
  IOC harvesting from alert history, threat actor and campaign profiles, and STIX/TAXII
  feed subscription management, all queryable via the REST API.

- **Cloud security posture management (CSPM/KSPM)** (`services/api/migrations/017_cspm.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/posture.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/posture.py`) —
  Ingests posture findings from cloud providers, tracks drift between scan runs, and
  surfaces a per-provider posture summary with suppress/resolve workflows.

- **Identity-centric correlation graph** (`services/api/migrations/018_identity_graph.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/identity_graph.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/identity_graph.py`) —
  Graph of users, devices, service accounts, and roles with typed relationship edges.
  Alerts link to identity nodes, enabling blast-radius queries and attack-path
  reconstruction.

- **Auto-generated board reports** (`services/api/migrations/019_board_reports.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/report.py`, `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/reports.py`) —
  Report templates and scheduled generation of PDF/HTML executive summaries. Artefacts
  are stored, versioned, and deliverable via email or webhook.

#### Platform

- **Dashboard metrics API** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/metrics.py`) —
  `/api/v1/metrics/dashboard` aggregates alert KPIs, case counts, connector source
  stats, top MITRE tactics, 24-hour alert trend, and threats-by-source for the
  frontend dashboard tiles. `/api/v1/metrics/alerts/trend` supports `1h / 24h / 7d / 30d`
  period buckets.

- **Tailscale connector** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/tailscale.py`) —
  Pulls audit logs and policy-file change events from the Tailscale API with
  OAuth client-credential and API-key auth, cursor-based pagination, and four-tier
  severity mapping.

- **AWS GuardDuty credential-exfiltration detection** (`detections/cloud/aws-guardduty-instance-credential-exfiltration.yaml`) —
  Sigma rule covering EC2 instance credential exfiltration via `UnauthorizedAccess:IAMUser/InstanceCredentialExfiltration`.

---

### Click-and-connect cloud connector platform

This pass turns connectors from a hardcoded, code-edit-only feature into a
runtime, schema-driven, click-and-connect surface — and lights up nine new
cloud / SaaS / VCS sources (Microsoft Entra, Azure Activity, Defender XDR,
GCP Cloud Audit, GCP SCC, Microsoft 365 audit, Google Workspace, Cloudflare,
GitHub) on top of the original CrowdStrike / Splunk / AWS Security Hub /
Okta / Microsoft Sentinel set.

#### Added

- **`CredentialVault`** (`services/api/app/security/credential_vault.py`,
  `services/connectors/app/security/credential_vault.py`) — Fernet
  (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256) wrapper for `auth_config` JSON, keyed off the
  new `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY` env var. Supports `MultiFernet` rotation via
  `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ROTATION_FROM`. The `services/connectors`
  read-path mirror decrypts only; writes always go through the API
  service. Documented in [docs/operations/credentials](apps/docs/docs/operations/credentials.md).
- **Self-describing connector schemas** (`services/connectors/app/connectors/base.py`)
  — `BaseConnector` gained a `Field` / `OAuthHints` / `ConnectorSchema`
  trio and an abstract `schema()` classmethod. Each connector class is now
  the source of truth for its own `name`, `connector_category`, fields
  (text / secret / select / textarea / oauth), default poll interval, and
  hosted-OAuth roadmap hints. The hardcoded dict in
  `services/connectors/app/api/router.py` is gone — schema responses come
  from the registry built in `services/connectors/app/connectors/__init__.py`.
- **`/api/v1/connectors` CRUD endpoints**
  (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/connectors.py`,
  `services/api/app/schemas/connector.py`) — `GET /catalog`, `POST /test`,
  `GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE /instances`, `POST /instances/{id}/test`.
  Tenant-scoped via the existing auth dependency, secrets encrypted on
  write through the vault, and proxied to the connectors microservice for
  schema lookups and live `Test connection` calls.
- **`ConnectorScheduler`** (`services/connectors/app/scheduler.py`) —
  APScheduler in-process inside `services/connectors`, started in the
  FastAPI lifespan. One job per enabled instance, polls
  `fetch_alerts(since_seconds=300)` every 5 min by default
  (`connector_config.poll_interval_seconds` overrides per instance),
  decrypts via the read-path vault, normalizes events through the
  connector's `normalize()` method, and pushes the batch to
  `services/ingest/v1/ingest/batch` via the new `IngestClient`. Set
  `AISOC_CONNECTORS_DISABLE_SCHEDULER=1` to skip wiring the scheduler in
  tests.
- **Nine new connectors** in `services/connectors/app/connectors/`:
  `azure_entra` (Microsoft Graph audit logs), `azure_activity` (ARM
  Activity Log via Resource Graph + blast-radius `_HIGH_BLAST_RADIUS_VERBS`
  list), `azure_defender` (Microsoft Graph Security alerts),
  `gcp_cloud_audit` (Cloud Logging API with hand-rolled RS256 JWT
  signing for service-account auth), `gcp_scc` (Security Command Center
  findings, same JWT signer), `m365_audit` (Office 365 Management
  Activity API, sharing the Azure AD app from `azure_entra`),
  `google_workspace` (Reports API with domain-wide delegation),
  `cloudflare` (Audit Logs), and `github` (Org Audit Log + Code Scanning
  alerts). Every connector ships unit tests covering schema contract,
  normalization, and `test_connection()` happy/sad paths
  (`services/connectors/tests/test_*_connectors.py`,
  `test_schemas.py`, `test_scheduler.py`).
- **Frontend click-and-connect wizard**
  (`apps/web/src/components/connectors/AddConnectorModal.tsx`,
  `ConnectorInstanceList.tsx`, rewired
  `ConnectorsView.tsx`, typed client in `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`) —
  two-step modal: (1) catalog grid grouped by category, (2)
  schema-driven form with `text` / `secret` / `select` / `textarea`
  fields, an inline `Test connection` button, and a `Save & enable`
  action. `framer-motion` for transitions, `react-hot-toast` for
  feedback. Existing connector cards now render from the live API via
  SWR.
- **Marketplace + plugin manifests** —
  `plugins/{azure-entra, azure-activity, azure-defender, gcp-cloud-audit,
  gcp-scc, m365-audit, google-workspace, cloudflare, github}/plugin.yaml`
  carry the new `schema()` shape so `scripts/build_marketplace.py` can
  surface them in the in-app Marketplace, and
  `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json` is regenerated via
  `pnpm marketplace:sync`.
- **Documentation** — `apps/docs/docs/connectors/index.md` (catalog
  landing with a connector walkthrough and category taxonomy), nine
  per-connector setup walkthroughs (prereqs, scopes, screenshots),
  `apps/docs/docs/operations/credentials.md` (vault threat model, key
  rotation procedure, hosted-OAuth roadmap), and a new `Connectors`
  section in `apps/docs/sidebars.ts`.

#### Changed

- **`services/api/app/core/config.py`** — added `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`,
  `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ROTATION_FROM`, `CONNECTORS_SERVICE_URL`,
  `CONNECTORS_SERVICE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. Documented in `.env.example`.
- **`services/api/app/main.py`** — the new `/api/v1/connectors` router is
  mounted alongside the existing v1 router set.
- **`services/connectors/app/api/router.py`** — schema responses lookup
  the registry instead of returning a hardcoded dict; new
  `POST /connectors/{connector_id}/test` endpoint runs an
  unauthenticated dry-run `test_connection()` for the wizard's
  pre-save Test step.
- **`services/connectors/app/main.py`** — the FastAPI lifespan now wires
  the scheduler, with `AISOC_CONNECTORS_DISABLE_SCHEDULER` honored for
  tests and CI.

#### Why this matters

Before this pass: adding a connector meant editing Python in three places,
shipping a release, and reading docs to discover the auth fields. Secrets
sat in plain JSON in Postgres. After this pass: connectors are runtime
data; secrets are encrypted with a key the operator controls; rotation
is a documented procedure; the wizard's `Test connection` round-trip
catches bad credentials before they're saved; and the per-connector docs
each give an analyst a 5-minute path from "I have a tenant" to "alerts
are flowing into the console."

---

### Eval harness v1.4 — synthetic telemetry + per-template macros

This pass addresses two questions raised on the public launch thread about
the v5.2 eval harness:

1. **"Any interest in shipping synthetic telemetry (M365 audit, CloudTrail,
   Sysmon) backing each incident?"** — Yes. A companion
   `synthetic_telemetry.jsonl` corpus is now generated alongside
   `synthetic_incidents.json` and gives connector and Sigma PRs a concrete
   contract to wire against without provisioning a real tenant.
2. **"INC-EVAL-044, 099, and 154 are the same template with `{user}/{host}`
   swapped — what does the multiplier buy vs. the dilution in regression
   signal?"** — The multiplier still buys breadth for connector regressions,
   but the eval suites now report a per-template macro alongside the
   per-case mean so a single broken template (~4 cases) moves the regression
   signal by ~1.8% rather than ~0.5%, and the failing template IDs are
   surfaced inline.

#### Added

- **Synthetic telemetry corpus**
  (`services/agents/tests/eval_data/synthetic_telemetry.jsonl`,
  `scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py`) — 361 backing events spanning 14
  log sources (Sysmon, Windows Security, M365 audit, Azure sign-in,
  CloudTrail, Linux auditd, journald, EDR, DNS, web access, Kubernetes
  audit, GitHub audit, VPN, DB audit), wired to all 200 incidents. Each
  event is a templated dictionary with `{user}/{host}/{ip}/{campaign}`
  placeholders resolved against the incident it backs, and carries the
  fields a real connector pivots on (process tree, principal, source IP,
  log source, event ID).
- **Telemetry event factories + recursive resolver**
  (`scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py`) — `_sysmon`, `_winsec`, `_m365`,
  `_azure_signin`, `_cloudtrail`, `_auditd`, `_journald`, `_edr`, `_dns`,
  `_web`, `_k8s`, `_github`, `_vpn`, `_db` produce base event shapes; a
  recursive resolver walks nested dicts and substitutes incident
  context. The 55 templates in `_TEMPLATES` each now carry a
  `template_id`, a `template_index`, and a tuple of telemetry events.
- **Schema + coverage gate** (`services/agents/tests/test_synthetic_telemetry.py`)
  — five new assertions: every incident has ≥ 1 backing event, every
  expected source is present, every event carries the source-specific
  pivot fields a real connector needs, all placeholders resolve, and no
  single template dominates the source distribution.
- **Per-template macros on every scoring suite**
  (`services/agents/tests/test_mitre_accuracy.py`,
  `test_investigation_completeness.py`, `test_response_quality.py`,
  `scripts/run_evals.py`) — each result now carries a
  `per_template_summary()` (mean, median, min, max, count, failing IDs)
  alongside the per-case mean, plus a new test gating macro accuracy ≥
  0.80 for MITRE / completeness and ≥ 0.75 for response-plan quality. A
  template-distribution-balance test asserts no single template accounts
  for > 5% of incidents (currently 0.5–2.0% each).
- **`run_evals.py` output expansion** — each suite headline now prints
  the per-case mean *and* the per-template macro with the failing
  template IDs inline; the human-readable summary appends a synthetic-
  telemetry footer (event count, source count, incident coverage, file
  path); `--json` output adds `per_template` and `telemetry` blocks.

#### Changed

- **Incident schema** — `synthetic_incidents.json` entries now include
  `template_id` (e.g. `m365_admin_impersonation`) and `template_index`
  fields. Existing fields are unchanged. Regenerated deterministically
  from the seeded RNG.
- **`apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md`** — added a "What's new (v1.4)"
  section, a "Per-case vs. per-template metrics" section explaining the
  ~0.5% vs ~1.8% sensitivity argument with worked examples, and a new
  "Synthetic telemetry corpus" section documenting the 14 sources, the
  pivot fields, the placeholder resolver, and the five schema/coverage
  checks. The "Help us harden the harness" call-outs now include adding
  a connector + Sigma rule against the corpus and adding a new template
  with backing telemetry. The "What this is not" section is updated to
  call out that the corpus is hand-shaped (not captured from a live
  tenant) and that the per-template macro is the non-tautological signal
  on top of the otherwise self-consistent gates.
- **`README.md`** — capability bullet rewritten to call out five suites
  (was four), 55 distinct templates, per-case + per-template macros, and
  the synthetic-telemetry coverage gate. The comparison table flags the
  eval harness as having a synthetic-telemetry corpus + per-template
  macros. Step 5b (`Run the public eval harness`) documents the new
  `python scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py` workflow for regenerating
  the dataset and the corpus together.
- **Eval signature on completeness + response-quality runs** — calls
  from `run_evals.py` now use `keep_per_incident=True` so the per-
  template summary is computable. Default behaviour unchanged for
  existing direct callers.

#### Why this matters

The v5.2 harness gave deterministic numbers but two real concerns existed:
duplicates could mask a broken template behind 199 working duplicates, and
there was no concrete telemetry shape for connector contributors to wire
against. v1.4 closes both: the per-template macro is the dilution-resistant
regression signal that surfaces template-class breaks, and the synthetic
telemetry corpus is the connector-development contract.

---

### Honesty + scale pass (P0–P4 of the post-gimmick improvement plan)

This is a "fix the foundations" pass: tighten security defaults, drop
overclaims, harden CI, fix DX rough edges, scale detection content from
~200 to 6,913 rules with explicit tiering, and ship a public demo
hosted on `tryaisoc.com` via Cloudflare Tunnel.

#### Security defaults (P0)

- **GraphQL tenant scoping** (`services/api/app/graphql/`) — every
  resolver is wrapped with a `tenant_scope` helper, GraphiQL is forced
  off in production, and a tenant-isolation regression test asserts
  cross-tenant reads return 0 rows.
- **Plugin signature gate** (`services/api/app/services/plugin_manager.py`,
  `packages/plugin-sdk-py/src/aisoc_plugin_sdk/loader.py`,
  `packages/plugin-sdk-go/aisoc/loader.go`) — Ed25519 signature
  verification is required before loading any plugin. `PLUGIN_TRUST_MODE`
  controls policy: `strict` (default, signed only), `permissive` (warn
  + load), `dev` (skip). Publisher signing flow is documented in
  `packages/plugin-sdk-py/README.md` and `packages/plugin-sdk-go/README.md`.
- **`/metrics` and compose hardening** (`docker-compose.yml`,
  `docker-compose.demo.yml`, `services/api/app/main.py`,
  `services/api/app/core/security.py`) — service ports bind to
  `127.0.0.1` by default, the API logs a loud warning if `SECRET_KEY`
  is unset or default, the `admin` role permissions are corrected to
  match the documented matrix, and `/metrics` is gated behind
  `METRICS_TOKEN`.

#### Honesty surface (P1)

- **Fusion pipeline framing** (`services/agents/app/fusion/`,
  `apps/docs/docs/architecture.md`) — replaced "real fusion pipeline"
  with the actual scope (rule-based + ML scoring fan-in, no
  reinforcement learning).
- **CI cadence wording** (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) — "every
  commit" → "every push and PR to `main`".
- **Eval harness honesty** (`scripts/eval/`, `apps/docs/docs/`) —
  removed "Macro F1" references, reframed the 200-incident synthetic
  dataset as substrate self-consistency, dropped the hardcoded
  `SUITES` constant, fixed the broken `--report` flag, and aligned
  Prophet usage in code and docs.

#### CI gates (P2)

- **No more `|| true`** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — removed every
  silent failure suppression.
- **Web Vitest smoke** — `apps/web` ships a Vitest suite covering
  marketplace filters, detection coverage view, and core layouts.
- **SDK + service jobs** — added Python pytest + Vitest jobs for
  `packages/sdk-{py,ts,go}` and `packages/plugin-sdk-{py,go}`, plus
  pytest jobs for `services/{api,agents,actions,connectors}`.
- **Detection + playbook validation in CI**
  (`.github/workflows/validate-detections.yml`,
  `.github/workflows/check-openapi.yml`) — `validate_detections.py`
  runs against all 6,913 rules and the OpenAPI spec is regenerated
  and compared on every PR.

#### DX (P3)

- **`aisoc-doctor` probes fixed** (`tools/aisoc-doctor/`) — checks
  match the actual ports, env var names, and service URLs.
- **CLI consistency** (`packages/cli/`, `README.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/`) — `npx aisoc` and `aisoc` resolve identically;
  package names, missing pnpm scripts, and the `mcp` service
  reference are corrected; branching/tooling and env var names match
  across docs.
- **Infra READMEs** — `infra/k8s/`, `infra/helm/`, `infra/terraform/`,
  `infra/render/`, `infra/fly/`, `infra/railway/`, `infra/coolify/`
  each have a `README.md` documenting prerequisites, secrets, and
  invocation.

#### Detection scale + tiering (P4)

- **800 native rules** — added 600 new Sigma-shaped detections across
  five new spec modules (`scripts/detection_specs_part3_cloud.py`,
  `_identity.py`, `_endpoint.py`, `_network.py`,
  `_application.py`), each with `match_when`, MITRE tagging, and
  auto-generated positive/negative fixtures via
  `scripts/detection_specs_part3_helpers.py`. Native total:
  200 → **800**.
- **6,113 imported rules with provenance** — wired importers under
  `tools/detection_import/{sigma,splunk,chronicle,car}_importer.py`
  for SigmaHQ, Splunk Security Content, Chronicle, and MITRE CAR.
  Each imported rule is tagged with its source, license, and original
  ID; rules whose mappings cannot be replayed against AiSOC fixtures
  are quarantined under `detections/<source>-imports/quarantine/`
  (~5,937 quarantined, ~6,113 active).
- **Title → name migration** — imported YAMLs now use the canonical
  `name:` field instead of `title:`, matching `validate_detections.py`'s
  required schema. `tools/detection_import/common.py` was updated and
  6,113 existing files were migrated in place.
- **Marketplace tier UX** (`apps/web/src/components/marketplace/MarketplaceView.tsx`,
  `MarketplaceView.test.tsx`, `marketplace/index.json`,
  `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json`,
  `scripts/build_marketplace.py`) — items now expose a `tier` field
  (`stable` / `beta` / `imported` / `community`), the marketplace UI
  defaults to `stable` and shows per-tier counts on filter chips,
  and `build_marketplace.py` infers tiers from `plugin.yaml` and
  source paths.
- **MITRE ATT&CK coverage view** (`apps/web/src/app/(app)/detection/coverage/`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/mitreTactics.ts`) — new in-app dashboard rendering
  the coverage matrix from the marketplace index.
- **Documentation refresh** — updated `README.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/intro.md`, `apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/concepts/detections.md`,
  `apps/docs/docs/contributing/dev-setup.md`,
  `detections/README.md`, and `.github/workflows/validate-detections.yml`
  to reflect 800 native + ~6,000 imported (filterable by tier) and
  drop stale "200+ rules" claims.

#### Public demo on `tryaisoc.com`

- **Cloudflare Tunnel infra** (`infra/cloudflare/`) — `config.yml.example`,
  `tunnel.sh`, and a README explaining how to run the demo profile
  behind `tryaisoc.com` via `cloudflared`. Tunnel script reads
  `DOMAIN`, `TUNNEL_NAME`, `SUBDOMAINS`, `SKIP_DNS`, `SKIP_RUN` env
  vars; defaults publish apex + `api.`, `ws.`, `docs.` subdomains.
- **`pnpm demo:public` script** (`scripts/demo-public.sh`) — boots
  `docker-compose.demo.yml` (read-only demo profile with seeded
  incidents) via `pnpm aisoc:demo --no-open`, then brings up the
  Cloudflare Tunnel that maps `tryaisoc.com` → web (`:3000`),
  `api.tryaisoc.com` → api (`:8000`), `ws.tryaisoc.com` → realtime
  (`:4000`), and `docs.tryaisoc.com` → Docusaurus (`:3001`).
  Companion scripts: `pnpm demo:public:tunnel-only` (skip stack
  bring-up, just run the tunnel) and `pnpm demo:public:setup`
  (provision tunnel + DNS without running cloudflared, for
  `cloudflared service install` flows).
- **Public-host-agnostic web bundle** (`apps/web/next.config.js`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`) — the Next.js client now emits
  same-origin relative paths (`/api/v1/...`, `/ws/...`) instead of
  `localhost:8000`-baked URLs, with server-side rewrites proxying
  to api/agents/realtime by Docker DNS name. The same image works
  on `localhost:3000`, behind Cloudflare Tunnel on `tryaisoc.com`,
  or behind any reverse proxy without a rebuild.
- **README "Try it live"** — top-of-README link to the public demo
  with a one-liner for hosting your own on a Cloudflare-managed
  domain.

## [5.2.0] — 2026-05-04

### Added

This release groups four areas of work: an append-only investigation
ledger, a public eval harness, a mobile responder PWA, and a hosted
demo profile. Details below.

#### Auditable agent — Investigation Ledger

- **Investigation Ledger** (`services/api/migrations/008_investigation_ledger.sql`,
  `services/api/app/models/investigation.py`,
  `services/agents/app/investigator/ledger.py`) — every prompt the agent
  emits, every tool call, every retrieved evidence shard, and every
  rationale is persisted as an append-only `investigation_step` row,
  scoped to a tenant + case.
- **Investigation Ledger UI** (`apps/web/src/components/cases/InvestigationLedger.tsx`)
  — replayable step-by-step view in the case workspace with prompt,
  response, and tool-call diffs.
- **`GET /api/v1/investigations/*` endpoints** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/investigations.py`)
  for listing, retrieving, and replaying ledger entries by case.
- **Investigator graph upgrades**
  (`services/agents/app/investigator/{orchestrator,recon_agent,forensic_agent,responder_agent,report_writer_agent,state}.py`)
  — every node now writes a ledger entry on entry and exit, including
  the structured input it received and the structured output it produced.

#### Public eval harness — Pillar-1 eval suite

- **200-incident synthetic dataset**
  (`services/agents/tests/eval_data/synthetic_incidents.json`) — 200
  deterministic, regenerable cases covering all 14 MITRE ATT&CK enterprise
  tactics across roughly the top 50 techniques. Generated by
  `scripts/generate_eval_incidents.py`.
- **Four eval gates** under `services/agents/tests/`:
  - `test_alert_reduction.py` — **real measurement**: 1 000 noisy alerts →
    ~250 incidents via 3-tier fusion, with explicit storm and
    near-duplicate handling
  - `test_mitre_accuracy.py` — **substrate self-consistency gate**:
    tactic-level accuracy / precision / recall / F1 between the
    hand-curated extractor and the dataset that was written to feed it
  - `test_investigation_completeness.py` — **substrate self-consistency
    gate**: evidence-keyword coverage on a templated report
  - `test_response_quality.py` — **substrate self-consistency gate**:
    5-criterion offline rubric on a templated response plan (action class,
    severity awareness, MITRE alignment, evidence grounding, actionability)
- **`scripts/run_evals.py`** — one-shot harness with `--json` and `--ci`
  output modes. Total runtime ~25 ms on a laptop. CI-gated on every
  commit via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Runs deterministic substrate code
  against synthetic incidents — does not call the live LLM agent.
- **Public eval harness page** (`apps/docs/docs/benchmark.md`,
  `apps/web/src/app/benchmark/page.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/benchmark/`) — published numbers, full
  method, comparison to other AI SOC offerings, and explicit framing of
  which suites measure substrate self-consistency vs real behaviour.

#### Mobile responder — Responder PWA

- **Responder PWA** (`apps/web/src/app/(responder)/`,
  `apps/web/src/components/responder/`,
  `apps/web/src/components/pwa/`) — installable, offline-aware, push-
  enabled responder console for on-call analysts. Service worker at
  `apps/web/public/sw.js`, manifest at `apps/web/public/manifest.json`,
  offline shell at `apps/web/public/offline.html`.
- **Passkey authentication** (`services/api/app/models/responder.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/passkeys.py`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/responder/`) — WebAuthn registration and login for
  the Responder surface; FIDO2 platform authenticators only, no SMS
  fallback.
- **On-call schedule + handoff** (`services/api/app/models/responder.py`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/oncall.py`) — current responder per
  tenant, surfaced in the Responder home page and in alert pages on the
  desktop console.
- **Approvals workflow** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/approvals.py`)
  — long-lived approval requests for blast-radius-gated SOAR actions,
  approvable from the Responder PWA with hardware-attested passkey.
- **Web Push delivery** (`services/realtime/src/push.ts`,
  `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/push.py`) — VAPID-signed push
  notifications wired into the realtime gateway. Subscriptions persist
  per-device and follow the on-call rotation.
- **Migration** — `services/api/migrations/009_responder_pwa.sql`.

#### Ambient Copilot

- **Contextual actions** (`services/agents/app/api/contextual.py`,
  `apps/web/src/components/alerts/AlertDetailView.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/cases/CaseWorkspace.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/detections/RuleEditor.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/playbooks/PlaybookEditor.tsx`) — the AI Copilot
  now reads the surface the analyst is standing on (alert / case / rule /
  playbook) and proposes the next two or three concrete actions with the
  correct payloads pre-filled. One click invokes the agent with the
  right tool.
- **Investigator graph awareness** — every contextual action is grounded
  in the same Investigation Ledger so the analyst sees, before clicking,
  which prompts and tool calls will be issued.

#### MCP server — first-class IDE / chat integration

- **`@aisoc/mcp`** (`services/mcp/`) — Model Context Protocol server
  exposing 11 AiSOC tools to Claude Desktop, Cursor, Cody, and Continue.
- **Discovery tools** — `aisoc_list_alerts`, `aisoc_list_cases`,
  `aisoc_query_detections`.
- **Deep-dive tools** — `aisoc_get_case`, `aisoc_get_investigation`,
  `aisoc_get_alert`.
- **Action / replay tools** — `aisoc_run_investigation`,
  `aisoc_replay_decision`, `aisoc_explain_step`, `aisoc_create_case`,
  `aisoc_assign_alert`. The replay set walks the Investigation Ledger
  step-by-step inside the IDE / chat.
- **Install command** — `npx -y @aisoc/mcp install --host claude --aisoc-url … --api-key …`.
- **Documentation** — `apps/docs/docs/integrations/mcp.md`,
  `services/mcp/README.md`.

#### Hosted demo — `pnpm aisoc:demo`

- **Slim demo profile** (`docker-compose.demo.yml`) — postgres + redis +
  kafka + api + agents + realtime + web. ClickHouse, OpenSearch, Neo4j,
  and Qdrant are gated behind compose profiles for production.
- **Prebuilt images** — `ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-{api,agents,realtime,web,…}`
  built and published by `.github/workflows/publish-images.yml` on every
  release tag.
- **One-shot orchestrator** (`scripts/aisoc-demo.ts`) — pulls images,
  brings up the stack, waits on healthchecks, seeds canonical demo data,
  kicks off an agent investigation against a seeded case, and opens the
  browser at `/cases/<uuid>` with the live ledger view selected.
- **Demo mode middleware** (`services/api/app/middleware/demo_mode.py`)
  — gates write operations, resets state every UTC midnight, and
  watermarks the UI as read-only. Tests at
  `services/api/tests/test_demo_mode.py`.
- **Target time-to-first-investigation:** roughly 3–5 minutes on a warm
  Docker daemon, depending on image cache state.
- **Cleanup** — `pnpm aisoc:demo:down` removes the volumes; logs at
  `pnpm aisoc:demo:logs`.

#### Deployment — one-click everywhere

- **Fly.io** (`infra/fly/`) — first-class config for `api`, `agents`,
  `realtime`, `web`. Deploys via `infra/fly/fly-demo-deploy.sh`,
  ~$14/mo for the whole stack.
- **Render** (`render.yaml`) — managed, sleep-on-idle
  config suitable for hobbyists and design partners.
- **Railway** (`infra/railway/railway.toml`) — pay-as-you-go PaaS.
- **Coolify** (`infra/coolify/README.md`) — self-hosted on your own VPS,
  reuses the existing `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Marketplace — content as code

- **~200 detection rules** in `detections/` covering MITRE ATT&CK
  Enterprise (cloud, identity, endpoint, network, application). Sigma
  format, with MITRE technique IDs in `tags`, fixtures under
  `detections/fixtures/`, and `detections/README.md` documenting the
  schema.
- **50+ response playbooks** in `playbooks/packs/v1/` — IAM, EDR,
  network, application, generic. JSON DSL with explicit decision trees,
  human-approval gates, and rollback steps. Schema in
  `playbooks/README.md`.
- **15 plugins** in `plugins/` — both Go and Python implementations for
  CrowdStrike, Splunk, Sentinel, AWS Security Hub, Okta, Cloudflare WAF,
  Defender, GuardDuty, Pagerduty, Slack, Teams, Jira, ServiceNow,
  VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB. Each ships with manifests, tests, and SDK
  helpers.
- **Marketplace index** (`marketplace/index.json`,
  `apps/web/public/marketplace/index.json`) — auto-generated by
  `scripts/build_marketplace.py` from the on-disk content tree.
- **Validation tooling** —
  - `scripts/validate_detections.py` (Sigma + MITRE ID schema)
  - `scripts/validate_playbooks.py` and `scripts/lint_playbooks.py`
    (DSL well-formedness + safety)
  - `.github/workflows/{validate-detections,validate-playbooks,sync-marketplace}.yml`
    enforce the gates on every PR.
- **In-app marketplace** (`apps/web/src/app/(app)/marketplace/page.tsx`,
  `apps/web/src/components/marketplace/MarketplaceView.tsx`) — filterable
  by category, ratings, verified vs community badge.

#### Plugin & client SDKs

- **`packages/plugin-sdk-go`** — Go plugin SDK
  (`module github.com/beenuar/aisoc/plugin-sdk-go`) with action,
  connector, enricher, registry, widget, and loader primitives.
  Examples under `packages/plugin-sdk-go/examples/`.
- **`packages/plugin-sdk-py`** — Python plugin SDK with the matching
  primitives, decorators, and a registry. Tests under
  `packages/plugin-sdk-py/tests/`.
- **`packages/sdk-py`** (PyPI: `aisoc-sdk`) — async Python client SDK
  for the AiSOC API.
- **`packages/sdk-ts`** (npm: `@aisoc/sdk`) — TypeScript client SDK
  with auto-generated types.
- **`packages/sdk-go`** — Go client SDK with OpenAPI-generated models.

#### Marketing & docs

- **`/why-open-source`** page (`apps/web/src/app/why-open-source/page.tsx`)
  — long-form description of the project's open-source posture and
  trade-offs.
- **Updated landing** (`apps/web/src/components/landing/{Hero,LandingNav,Footer,OpenSource}.tsx`)
  — the "live demo" button lands directly on a seeded investigation;
  comparison rows reference specific behaviours rather than generic
  claims.
- **Docusaurus refresh** — new MCP integration page, benchmark page,
  Investigation Ledger references, Responder PWA mentions in concepts
  and quickstart.

### Changed

- **Repository home** — all `cyble-inc/AiSOC` and `aisoc-os/aisoc` URLs
  updated to `beenuar/AiSOC` across docs, README, SDKs, and benchmark
  badges.
- **`packages/sdk-go` module path** is now `github.com/beenuar/aisoc/sdk-go`
  for the API client SDK; the plugin SDK is at
  `github.com/beenuar/aisoc/plugin-sdk-go`.
- **`alerts` API** (`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/alerts.py`,
  `services/api/app/models/alert.py`) — surfaces copilot context
  (suggested next actions) inline on the alert detail response.
- **API router** (`services/api/app/api/v1/router.py`) — wires up
  `approvals`, `investigations`, `marketplace`, `oncall`, `passkeys`,
  `push`.

### Fixed

- **CI Docker build contexts** — `.github/workflows/{ci,release,publish-images}.yml`
  now set explicit `context` and `file` parameters per service; multi-
  service builds no longer race on a stale build root.
- **Docker Compose obsolete `version` warning** — removed `version: '3.8'`
  from `docker-compose.demo.yml`.
- **Repository hygiene** — added `.gocache/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`,
  `apps/docs/.docusaurus/`, `apps/docs/build/`,
  `plugins/**/*-build-test`, `plugins/**/*-build`,
  `eval_report.json`, and `eval_mitre_accuracy_report.json` to
  `.gitignore`. Removed previously tracked Docusaurus cache and local
  IDE hook state files from the index.
