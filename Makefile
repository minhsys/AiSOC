# AiSOC — one command per thing you actually want to do.
#
# There is exactly one canonical answer to "how do I run this", and it lives
# here. `docker compose` still works directly; these targets are the supported
# spelling and are what the README and CI use, so they cannot drift from the
# documentation without a red build.
#
# Profiles (see docs/architecture/README.md):
#   core  — default. postgres, redis, kafka, ingest, fusion, api, web, agents,
#           the LLM gateway and the local model behind it, and the threat-intel
#           feed with its vector store. The smallest deployment that can take an
#           event, produce an alert, and triage it with a real model — with no
#           credentials at all. ~8GB RAM.
#   full  — core plus the event lake (ClickHouse), entity graph (Neo4j),
#           full-text search (OpenSearch), enrichment and scheduled connectors.
#           ~12GB RAM.
#   demo  — core plus clearly-labelled synthetic data.

# The address `up` prints for the console. README tells operators deploying
# somewhere that is not a laptop to set AISOC_CONSOLE_URL "so the printed
# address is the one people browse to" — and `up` printed a hardcoded
# http://localhost:3000 regardless, two lines above `bootstrap`, which reads
# the variable and printed the configured address. An operator on a host
# reached by its LAN address got both, the wrong one first, and localhost
# resolves on their machine to something that is not this console.
#
# Recursively expanded on purpose: `up` depends on `env`, which creates .env,
# so this has to be read when the recipe line runs rather than when the
# Makefile is parsed.
#
# Only the console line is derived. `API:` below stays loopback because it is
# accurate as written — the API publishes on 127.0.0.1:8000 of this host — and
# a console URL behind a reverse proxy says nothing about where the API port
# is, so deriving one from the other would trade a wrong address for a guess.

#
# This runs *before* compose because compose only interpolates `.env`; there is

# at `up` time is baked into every container's environment until the next `up`.

# process holding the port nor what to do about it. Half the stack is running
# by then, so the error also arrives after a minute of unrelated output.

# Waits on the services that declare a healthcheck, and refuses to call a
# stack up while any container is dead.
#
# The old loop read `ps` without `-a` and looked only at Health. An *exited*
# container is absent from that listing entirely and a *restarting* one
# reports no health, so both were invisible: `make up-full` printed
# "Full profile up." with OpenSearch OOM-killed and threatintel in a crash
# loop. A container that is not running is the one thing a wait loop must
# never score as success.
#
# `exited` alone is not that thing, though, and reading it as such broke the
# documented command on every machine. `ollama-pull` is a one-shot: it fetches
# the model and exits 0, and `litellm` waits on
# `service_completed_successfully`, so by the time `docker compose up -d`
# returns the puller has *always* exited. `make up` therefore ended in
# "These services are not running: ollama-pull" on the first run and every
# run after it — a stack that was entirely healthy, reported as broken, by
# the step whose job is to say whether it is healthy. The exit code is what
# separates the two cases: 0 is a one-shot that did its job, anything else is
# a container that died.
#
# The fields are `|`-separated rather than space-separated because a service
# with no healthcheck prints an *empty* Health, and awk's default splitting
# collapses the run of whitespace — so `ollama-pull exited  0` parsed as three
# fields with the exit code in $$3 and nothing in $$4, and the new exit-code
# test read an empty string on exactly the row it was written for.
