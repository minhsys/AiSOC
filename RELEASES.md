# AiSOC release notes

This file mirrors what used to live in the "What's new" section of [`README.md`](README.md). The complete, machine-readable inventory (with file paths, env-var diffs, and per-release test counts) lives in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

> **TL;DR for first-time visitors:** AiSOC is on `v17.0.0`, released 2026-10-05. **One breaking change and one number that changes meaning without erroring** — the second is the one to read twice. `POST /api/v1/detection-loop/suggest` and its two `GET /detection-loop/suggestions` reads are removed with their three schemas; no migration is needed because none of them ever worked, since they queried `aisoc_alerts`, `aisoc_detection_rules` and `alerts.evidence`, none of which any migration creates. The governed equivalent is `POST /api/v1/detection-proposals`. The quieter change: **`alerts.total` on `/metrics/dashboard` now counts open work** — `new`, `triaging`, `in_progress` — rather than every alert ever received, and the severity counts beside it are scoped the same way, because the console labels them *Active Alerts* and *Critical — Require immediate action*. A tenant who had resolved everything was still shown their entire historical intake as outstanding, and the number only ever rose. Closed work is now reported separately as `alerts.resolved`. **Every approval was failing**: the dispatch built its principal from two attributes `CurrentUser` has never defined, so the actions service received an empty permission list and refused, while the approval row recorded the decision — the action never ran, for any role, including platform admin. **You can now choose where the model runs**: `make up` is unchanged (CPU, no account, no key), `make up-gpu` layers an NVIDIA device reservation onto the bundled Ollama, and `make up-host-llm` uses an Ollama you already run — the only route to a GPU on Apple Silicon, since Docker Desktop cannot pass Metal into a Linux container. `GET /api/v1/llm/runtime` reports where the model *actually* is by asking Ollama rather than reading the compose file back, because a reservation is a request and a model can still land on the CPU; it answers `unknown` for an idle instance rather than guessing. `POST /api/v1/llm/credentials/test` places one real one-token call, so a revoked key is found at the moment you save it instead of surfacing later as triage quietly falling back. Closed cases can be reopened through `POST /api/v1/cases/{id}/reopen` with a recorded reason; `PATCH` stays forward-only, which is what makes "this case was closed" mean something. Investigations now reason over the alerts' real `raw_event` payloads instead of a restated title, and the groundedness gate covers that path too — refusing to score an empty evidence set rather than demoting everything and appearing to catch hallucination. A period-over-period delta of `-93.75` rendered as `-9375%`; the global time-window selector drove no fetch at all. The chart publishes as **`7.4.0`**. Everything below describes v16.0.1 and earlier, which this release does not change.
>
> **Previously:** AiSOC was on `v16.0.1`, released 2026-10-04. **A security release, no breaking changes.** It closes **GHSA-4gx4-x7gm-4xq8**, a high-severity privilege escalation reported by [HaiND](https://github.com/Haind03): the check that decides whether a caller may *confer* authority read the caller's static role, while the check that admits a caller to the route read its database-resolved permissions. Those are two different answers whenever a tenant uses database-backed RBAC — which is the configuration where it matters, since narrowing an account is what those tables are for. A `tenant_admin` deliberately restricted to `users:write` still carried 28 permissions statically and could grant itself the other 27. **If you use the `roles` and `user_roles` tables to restrict accounts, upgrade.** Deployments with no RBAC rows were never exposed, because the static map was already the correct answer for them. The report named one route; the resolver is shared, so five more had it — authoring a role, re-permissioning one, creating a user, delegating to a child tenant, and minting an API key, that last needing no target user and yielding a durable credential. `scripts/check_role_grant_scope.py` gains a direction that fails CI when a grant is measured against the wrong authority; its previous directions passed on the vulnerable tree because they asked only whether a route *reached* the chokepoint, and all six did. Also raises `serialize-javascript` to `>=7.1.2` and `http-cache-semantics` to `>=4.3.0`. The chart publishes as **`7.3.1`**. Everything below describes v16.0.0 and earlier, which this release does not change.
>
> **Previously:** AiSOC was on `v16.0.0`, released 2026-10-03. **One breaking change:** the `cases` table is gone and its rows live in `aisoc_cases`. Any SQL of your own against `cases` — a Grafana panel, a scheduled export — now fails with "relation does not exist" rather than returning stale rows, which is the intended behaviour. The theme is a single shape repeated seventeen times: **a mechanism that is complete, tested, and has no caller**, so it passes CI forever while doing nothing. SSO could not sign anyone in — `aisoc_sso_connections` was written by nothing, so every SAML and OIDC callback returned 403 on every deployment, while both handlers were fully tested. MTTA published a confident `0.0` because `alerts.first_seen_at` had no writer. The evidence chain an auditor exports was always `[]`. SLA reporting ran 350 lines of correct arithmetic over an empty table. The console's rule-Approve button could not succeed. The live agent evaluation imported a class that exists only in the historical prototype. And the two case tables never synchronised, so **every case an analyst created was invisible to every case metric** — which is the break above. Measured, not asserted: an agent answering "true positive" to everything scored **1.000** on the detection corpus and now scores **0.727**, because the benign class was derived from `response_class == "monitor"` and those incidents are BloodHound enumeration tagged T1087.002. The first live behavioural run published "unsafe action proposal rate 0.0%", which meant the agent proposed no actions at all; it now reports **not measured** and the verdict flip rate is **9.3%** from one manual run of the 200-incident synthetic corpus against a locally-served `llama3.2:3b`, which is not the model a hosted deployment resolves. New: detection lifecycle with rollback and separation of duties, content packs, alert prioritisation, case queues and escalation, legal hold and residency, workload identity and time-boxed elevation, restore paths for Neo4j/Qdrant/Redis, and inbound translation from Splunk SPL, Sentinel KQL and Elastic EQL — on the 2,005 rules bundled here, 1,734 translate and **1,711 of those only partially**. A 22-page technical guide ships as a PDF with real console screenshots. The chart publishes as **`7.3.0`**. Everything below describes v15.1.0 and earlier, which this release does not change.
>
> **Before that:** AiSOC was on `v15.1.0`, released 2026-10-03. **No breaking changes** — two routes are added and none removed, so every generated SDK client keeps working. The theme is the gap between a capability existing and a user reaching it: `v15.0.0` closed thirteen security defects sharing the shape *a control that exists, passes its tests and never runs*, and this release applies the same reading to the product. Playbooks could not act at all — `find_matching()` had no production caller, so no playbook had ever run from an alert, and the `approval` step was documented as a durable pause with nowhere to suspend to. A tenant's detection tuning never reached the streaming engine, so a rule turned off in the console kept firing. Every CloudTrail event collapsed onto a single alert, which a one-event pipeline test cannot reveal. Three things are worth reading before upgrading: **first run changed substantially** (`make up` resolves a port conflict instead of refusing to start, measured at 64 seconds from clone to signed-in console on a host with 5432 and 11434 both taken, and a new tenant lands on a setup wizard), **CloudTrail users will see more alerts**, and **the project-maturity table now means something** — `Stable` has a written definition in `docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md` and a gate, and the two rows that claimed CI coverage which existed nowhere were fixed rather than relabelled. New: signed, replayable evidence bundles at `GET /api/v1/investigations/{run_id}/bundle`, byte-identical across exports with prompts as digests and an OCSF 1.9.0 mapping checked against the published schema before use; and a copilot that cites every checkable claim to a ledger entry or labels it **uncited**. On the benchmark page, **verdict accuracy is published as *not measured*, with the reason** — every labelled corpus here is entirely malicious by construction, so an agent answering "true positive" to everything would post 100%, and `scripts/score_replay_set.py` refuses such a corpus with a test asserting this tree's own two are refused. The chart publishes as **`7.2.0`**. Everything below describes v15.0.0 and earlier, which this release does not change.

## What's new

`VERSION` is `17.0.0`. The **v17.0.0** release (2026-10-05) removes three
`/detection-loop/suggest*` routes that never worked — they queried three
relations no migration creates, so every caller was already receiving an
error — and changes one number's meaning without erroring, which is the
change to read twice: **`alerts.total` on `/metrics/dashboard` now counts
open work rather than every alert ever received**, with the severity counts
beside it scoped the same way. A panel charting cumulative intake from that
field will drop to the size of your queue; closed work moved to
`alerts.resolved`.

It also fixes an approval path that had never once succeeded — the dispatch
read two attributes the principal class does not define, so the actions
service received an empty permission list and refused while the approval row
recorded the decision — and adds a choice of **where the model runs**:
`make up` unchanged on CPU, `make up-gpu` for an NVIDIA device, or
`make up-host-llm` for an Ollama you already run, which is the only route to a
GPU on Apple Silicon. `GET /api/v1/llm/runtime` reports where the model
actually is by asking Ollama rather than reading the compose file back, and
`POST /api/v1/llm/credentials/test` finds a bad provider key at the moment you
save it. Closed cases can be reopened with a recorded reason. The full entry
is in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

The **v16.0.1** release (2026-10-04) was a security
release closing one high-severity privilege escalation
(**GHSA-4gx4-x7gm-4xq8**): a grant was measured against the caller's static
role rather than the permissions it was admitted on, so an account narrowed
through the database-backed RBAC tables could confer on itself anything its
unnarrowed role carried. Six routes shared the defect, not the one reported.
Upgrade if you use `roles` and `user_roles` to restrict accounts; a
deployment with no RBAC rows was never exposed. The full entry is in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

The **v16.0.0** release (2026-10-03) carried one
breaking change: the `cases` table is gone and its rows live in
`aisoc_cases`, so SQL of your own against the old name now fails loudly
rather than returning stale rows. It closes seventeen defects sharing one
shape — a mechanism that is complete, tested, and has no caller — of which
the most visible is that SAML and OIDC sign-in returned 403 on every
deployment because the connection table had no writer. The full entry is in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

The **v15.0.0** release (2026-10-01) is a security
release closing **thirteen defects**, each found by reading the code at
`v14.0.0` and each shipped with a reproduction that fails on the untouched
tree for the stated reason.

The ones with the widest blast radius: an **AI triage could teach the platform
to stop showing an attacker their own alerts** — three AI verdicts at ≥0.90
confidence on one evidence signature auto-closed every later alert sharing it,
and the corroboration threshold was never a mitigation because the attacker
picks how many alerts to send. **Both SSO handlers minted a signed session for
an identity nobody authenticated**, and since `python3-saml` was declared in no
install path, that branch was the *only* reachable path through the SAML
assertion consumer on every deployment. **Six of the seven `mssp_*` tables had
no row-level security**, so the query predicate was the single control between
one MSSP's portfolio and another's. And an operator could **grant a permission
in the console, watch it appear in the UI, and have 275 of 302 routes ignore
it**.

Two are breaking and are tabled in the `### BREAKING` sections of
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md): `/api/v1/shifts` is removed and
`/api/v1/threatintel/stix` reads answer 404 outside demo mode; and
`ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `production` on every documented path, which turns
several previously silent warnings into boot refusals. Upgrading is `make up`.

Three findings are worth more than the fixes. **A real database caught what a
static gate could not**: the obvious MSSP policies are mutually recursive and
Postgres answers `infinite recursion detected` on the first `SELECT`, while
`check_rls_policy_shape.py` passed throughout — shape is not liveness.
**Adding one keyword broke four writer signatures and no test failed on the
exception**, because the call sits inside `contextlib.suppress`; what surfaced
was a zero write-count in an unrelated replay test three files away.
And **the first design for database-backed permissions was wrong**: resolving
inside the permission check would have made a transient database fault deny
every request on the platform, so resolution happens at authentication and
fails *open* to the static map, deliberately.

The claim-to-gate matrix is at **255 rows, all GATED**. The chart publishes as
**`7.1.0`**.

`VERSION` was `14.0.0`. The **v14.0.0** release (2026-09-29) closes a HIGH
privilege-escalation advisory by scoping every grant to the granter: no
principal may confer a role, an API-key scope or an organisation membership
beyond what it holds itself, and the two wildcard roles are unreachable from
any API route. Six routes accepted authority from a request body and only one
was reported; `scripts/check_role_grant_scope.py` names all nine handlers when
run against the tree before the fix. The `### BREAKING` section of
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) tables the change per route.

`VERSION` was `13.0.1`. The **v13.0.1** patch (2026-09-29) shipped no application
change at all: it is the tag push that puts the corrected Helm chart into GHCR
as **`6.0.1`**, the first 6.x a user can actually pull. v13.0.0 left the
chart's own `version` at `5.9.2` while moving `appVersion`, and `helm push`
replaces without a word, so that coordinate meant `v12.3.2` or `v13.0.0`
depending on when it was fetched. The correction landed on `main` after the
tag and could not reach the registry from there — `release.yml` gates its
GHCR login, push and resolve steps on `github.event_name == 'push'`, so a
dispatch packages and lints and then stops on purpose. `scripts/check_chart_version.py`
now refuses the whole class before the push rather than after it. Everything
in the rest of this section describes **v13.0.0**, which this patch leaves
untouched.

The **v13.0.0** release (2026-09-29) works the
identity-only route debt down from **103 to 28** across five reviewed changes
by resource area, using only permissions that already existed in
`ROLE_PERMISSIONS`. It is a major because the break is behavioural: several
surfaces move to `settings:write`, which `soc_analyst`, `soc_lead` and
`threat_hunter` do not hold, so this is the first of these three releases where
a principal other than `viewer` loses access. Read the `### BREAKING` section
of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading — it names every route, the
permission it now requires, the roles that lose it, and the two ways to restore
access (a role that holds the permission, or the permission added to a custom
role or an API key's `scopes`). Two permission choices were rejected for
causing an outage rather than fixing a hole, and the rejections are pinned by
tests: `rules:write` on the hunt workbench would have locked out
`soc_analyst`, the role the `/hunt` page exists for, and `settings:write` on
`/insider-threat` would have taken watchlisting away from the analysts the
module is for.

**v13.0.0 highlights (September 29, 2026)**
- **75 routes gated, 28 deliberately left.** The remainder is not a backlog
  with no owner: eight SCIM routes authenticate a purpose-bound provisioning
  credential that has no role for `require_permission` to consult, four
  `/mssp/organizations` routes authorize through an organisation owner/admin
  check that a tenant role cannot substitute for, eleven are self-scoped to
  the caller's own row, and the last five carry a stated product question.
  `POST /kb/query` and `POST /community/plugins/{id}/rate` are pinned
  *ungated* by tests, so changing them takes a decision.
- **`POST /mssp/organizations` was an escalation into the part of that module
  that did authorize.** Founding an organisation makes the caller the `owner`
  that `_admin_scope` accepts, and the route was open to any authenticated
  user, so a read-only role could mint itself an administering principal in
  one request. It was found by a structural test asserting no state-changing
  route in the module is unguarded, not by reading the module.
- **Compliance evidence collection and review now take two different
  permissions**, so a `soc_lead` can produce an evidence item and cannot
  accept it. That is a role-level separation and weaker than the person-level
  separation of duties `services/actions` enforces on response approvals —
  migration 013 records `reviewed_by` and no collector column, so there is
  nobody to compare an approver against, and the stronger check is not
  claimed anywhere.
- **314 new tests, per route and in both directions.** Against the pre-fix
  tree the five suites fail 30/49, 35/55, 41/64, 45/65 and 44/68; `services/api`
  goes 3,537 → 3,819 passing with no unrelated test moving.

**v12.3.2 highlights (September 29, 2026)**

The **v12.3.2** release wires eleven
`require_permission` dependencies that FastAPI had been discarding, found
by sweeping the sibling modules for the omission behind
GHSA-wj5c-88hg-5926. The **v12.3.1** release earlier the same day is a
security patch: two reported advisories fixed, no feature change and nothing breaking.
It follows v12.3.0 the same day because a fix that sits on `main` is not a fix
anyone running the published images has.

**v12.3.1 highlights (September 29, 2026)**
- **GHSA-p37g-cjqx-56hq (critical) — SQL injection in the osquery allowlist.**
  A denylist that scanned rendered SQL for `--`, `/*` and `;` had never
  listed `'`. All six templates were injectable, not the one reported, since
  the numeric parameters were never coerced. Parameters now declare a type
  and anything else is refused, not escaped.
- **GHSA-wj5c-88hg-5926 (high) — missing function-level authorization.** Every
  remediation write route authenticated and none authorized, so a `viewer`
  could raise the tenant to L4 and pre-approve a high blast-radius verb. Now
  enforced on all six routes, including one the advisory does not name.
- **The router also committed before serialising**, returning HTTP 500 on a
  write that had already landed — so the regression tests assert the
  transaction did not commit rather than checking a status code.
- **A gate that asks whether a route authorizes**, not merely whether it
  authenticates: 103 of 246 state-changing routes make no authorization
  decision, recorded as a ceiling that can only fall.


**v12.3.0 highlights (September 29, 2026)**
- **Six deferrals closed, one recurring shape.** 8b (every shipped prompt
  registered, 3 -> 22, with the gate failing in both directions), 9b
  (approvals nobody answered now expire, safe default `rejected`), 5b (dead
  letters replayable from the Kafka offset, re-validated by the validator that
  refused them), 10b (the ingest checkpoint is a declared contract rather than
  an optional method 83 of 84 connectors lacked), 6b (a tenant's projected
  storage $/mo beside its LLM $/mo), and 3.5+ (the demo stack has a measured
  budget, 3m06s -> 1m39s).
- **A skipped upload no longer reports as a successful publish**, and
  something finally asks the registry after a release instead of reading the
  workflow's own result.
- **The weekly security digest stopped grading a repository A/100 across
  sources it could not read.** It had headlined an all-clear derived from one
  of three declared sources, and a byte-identical body each week froze
  `updated_at` so six consecutive successful runs looked abandoned.
- **Both grading-integrity controls are required now**, taking branch
  protection to 24 contexts, and deliberately only the two that report on a
  pull request: their two siblings skip there, and a skipped required check
  counts as passing.
- **A marketplace card counting playbooks was labelled Executable** — the
  number was right and the word was wrong, which in this repository means
  something specific.
- **Seventeen dependency updates**, with the SQLAlchemy 2.1.1 bumps checked
  against the greenlet hazard that reddened this repo before, and the `mcp`
  2.0 major refused with the signature diff that shows why.


**v12.2.0 highlights (September 28, 2026)**
- **Four package READMEs told you to install packages that do not exist.** Each
  deferred to `v8.0+`, a release that shipped four major versions ago, so the
  label read as availability. None of the eight first-party packages has ever
  been uploaded — the registries return 404 for all eight — while the release
  workflow's publish jobs report success, because only the upload step is
  credential-gated. A gate now asks the registry instead of trusting the
  workflow.
- **The claim-to-gate matrix is complete**: 238 rows, all GATED, no PARTIAL
  and no NO GATE. Phase 4 stays unchecked, because a funded hosted-model key
  is not something code can supply.
- **Completion bounds now reach the bundled model.** They had been rendered as
  `max_completion_tokens`, which Ollama ignores silently, so every investigator
  call was effectively unbounded — one ran to 40,960 tokens.
- **CI installs each service's committed lock as an exact closure**, so the
  version CI grades is the version the image ships.

## v11.2.0 (2026-09-26)

`VERSION` was `11.2.0`. The **v11.2.0** release (2026-09-26) answers a question that had been asked of this repository for months — *why 833 rules and not 5,000?* — and the answer was not a missing feature. (Claim-to-gate matrix at the v11.2.0 cut: 147 rows — 139 GATED / 8 PARTIAL / 0 NO GATE, counted from the table by `scripts/check_claim_gate_matrix.py`, which is the figure to recount rather than to quote.)

**Nothing in this release requires you to act, which is why it is a minor.** There is no configuration change, no migration and no API change. The connector fix only *adds* fields: it lifts the `System` and `EventData` containers into the namespace the matcher already read, and a connector-normalized key still wins on collision. What does change is that 2,603 rules evaluate where 833 did, and 1,687 of the additions are Windows rules that could never fire before — so expect more alerts from the same stream. Every imported rule carries its `upstream_status` onto the alert, so the 125 `experimental` ones can be filtered without disabling the rest.

**What "executable" means, because the whole figure rests on it.** A rule counts only after a vendor-shaped event has been replayed through the **real** connector `normalize()` and the **real** `DetectionEngine` and that rule was observed to produce a hit, with an empty event of the same shape producing nothing. Nothing is inferred from a directory, an `enabled:` key or the shape of a `detection:` block — and notably not from `check_detection_fields.py`, whose own docstring says it over-approximates and that "a false pass is a rule this gate should have caught". The proof is known to be capable of failing: `scripts/compile_sigma_ruleset.py --prove-gate` reverts the connector to its pre-fix behaviour and requires all 1,687 Windows rules to stop firing. **It is a claim about reachability, not about detection.** A rule that fires on a well-formed event of its own log source is reachable; that is not evidence it detects an attack, that it is tuned, or that it will be quiet.

**What is measured, and what is not.** Auto-triage now asks the provider for a JSON object rather than correcting prose afterwards. Measured over 50 alerts from the committed synthetic corpus, through the LiteLLM gateway exactly as production routes, against the bundled `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` at the production `temperature=0.0` / `max_tokens=512`: replies triage could use went from **44 of 50 to 50 of 50**. Every one of the six failures carried a correct verdict and confidence and a malformed `rationale`, and `finish_reason` was `stop` on all 50 calls, so truncation was not involved. The earlier published "7 of 19" does not reproduce and has been replaced everywhere by the repeatable measurement in `scripts/measure_triage_reliability.py`. **The recorded deployment walkthrough predates this fix and shows the old deterministic fallback**, which the walkthrough's own closing card states. **No hosted provider has ever been exercised** — there is still no funded key, and that remains a separate, unmade claim. The npm and PyPI packages are built and packed on every tag and **are still not uploaded**, because no registry credential exists; treat any install command for them as unavailable rather than broken.

**A known licence gap, still open.** The Sigma importer never captured the upstream `author:` field, so DRL-1.1 attribution travels as repository, upstream rule id, upstream path and licence — enough to find a rule, not enough to name who wrote it. The engine builds its attribution sentence from what the provenance block holds, so an alert reads short rather than crediting an author called `""`. Closing it needs a re-import. It is recorded in [the compilation report](docs/detections/sigma-compilation.md) rather than left to be discovered from the JSON.

**v11.2.0 highlights (September 26, 2026)**
- **Windows telemetry was unreachable, and nothing said so.** `CommandLine` appears in 2,173 public Sigma rules and `Image` in 2,300 — the two most-used fields in the corpus — and both resolved to `None` because the engine flattens `raw_event`'s *top level* and a Windows event puts its payload one level below that. The fix belongs in `windows_event.normalize()` rather than the engine, because `System` and `EventData` are names from the Windows event schema and the engine is shared by every connector. All 1,756 committed fixtures were replayed to confirm every existing native rule keeps its verdict, now a standing test rather than a one-off check.
- **1,770 Sigma rules ship and 1,362 are refused, each with a recorded reason.** The two largest: 556 whose log source no connector emits, and 464 whose negation would flip on a missing field — Sigma treats `not filter` as *true* when the field is absent and only `not_in` and `not_contains_any` do that here, so compiling the rest would turn "not this value" into "fires whenever the field is missing". Refusing is the design: a translation that is merely close changes what a rule means.
- **Upstream lifecycle status no longer decides whether an imported rule runs.** The importer had quarantined 2,844 `test` and 211 `experimental` rules on SigmaHQ status, which conflated whether a rule *can execute here* with how confident its authors are in its content. In SigmaHQ, `test` means reviewed and in community use. Fireability gates now; status is carried onto the rule and the alert so it can still be filtered; `deprecated` and `unsupported` are refused outright.
- **All 122 previously phantom-enabled rules are resolved.** 76 were marked enabled while the engine had never heard of them — they counted as shipped coverage and detected nothing. 46 became executable through the compiler; the rest are `enabled: false` with a `quarantine_reason` naming what each would need. `detection_truth_table.py --check` now fails on any such rule.
- **Eight windowed aggregation rules**, taking that family from 10 to 18 — failed-logon volume per host, password spray counted by distinct account rather than by attempt, service-install and scheduled-task bursts, remote-thread fan-out, and per-process DNS fan-out. The quarantine index had been telling contributors to skip this family for a loader that had existed for some time.
- **Four counters were still classifying rules by their directory.** `_quarantine/` stopped meaning "cannot run" when the compiler began translating rules where they sat, so the tools that had not moved to the compiled ruleset reported the old world while printing OK. The validator published "Quarantined: 5937" against a truth table saying 4,213 about the same tree; the coverage page selected from 1,054 candidates out of 2,603 executable rules and listed a category named `_quarantine`; and the marketplace published 7,016 detections against a README and truth table that both say 6,991 — the 25-rule gap being `detections/playbooks/`, which holds response playbooks, not rules. All four now read the compiled ruleset, which is why they agree.

The full inventory lives under `[11.2.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## v11.1.0 (2026-09-25)

`VERSION` was `11.1.0`. The **v11.1.0** release (2026-09-25) began as one user's bug report and ended as an audit of everything between this project's build output and the thing a stranger can actually run. (Claim-to-gate matrix at the v11.1.0 cut: 146 rows — 138 GATED / 8 PARTIAL / 0 NO GATE.)

**Nothing in this release requires you to act, which is why it is a minor.** `AISOC_API_URL`, `AISOC_AGENTS_URL` and `AISOC_REALTIME_URL` configure the console at run time and fall back to the addresses that were previously compiled in. `AISOC_CONSOLE_BIND_ADDR` and `AISOC_BIND_ADDR` both default to loopback, so a laptop install still exposes nothing by omission. The only removals are two variables the console never read.

**What is measured, and what is not.** A fresh `make up` runs AI triage against the bundled `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` with no credentials. At the time this shipped the published figure was 7 schema-valid replies in a measured run of 19. **That figure does not reproduce**: re-measured later over 50 alerts through the gateway, on the same model and the same production call, it reads **44 of 50** — see `[11.2.0]` in `CHANGELOG.md` for the method and for the change that took it to 50 of 50. When validation fails, triage falls back to the deterministic path and logs that it did. In the live QA for this release **both** triage runs fell back to that deterministic path — the token counts are real because the model genuinely was called; what failed was the shape of its reply. The recorded walkthrough's closing card states this rather than hiding it. **No hosted provider has ever been exercised** — there is still no funded key, and that remains a separate, unmade claim. The npm and PyPI packages are built and packed on every tag and **are still not uploaded**, because no registry credential exists; treat any install command for them as unavailable rather than broken.

**v11.1.0 highlights (September 25, 2026)**
- **The console's upstream addresses were frozen at image-build time, so a documented variable could not work.** `next build` inlines every `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value into the JavaScript bundle *and* compiles the destinations returned by `rewrites()` into `routes-manifest.json`. `next start` re-reads the config and logs that it did, which makes this look configurable while production routing is served from the manifest — so a pulled image could only ever talk to the hosts it was built against. It worked on the bundled stack by coincidence, because the baked `http://api:8000` is that service's DNS name on that network. The entrypoint now re-evaluates the real `rewrites()` against the container's environment before the server starts, and an address that is set and cannot be applied stops the container and names itself rather than starting on the built-in defaults.
- **A single-host deployment could not be reached at all.** Every host port published to a literal `127.0.0.1`, so the stack came up healthy and nothing outside the machine could reach it — including the browser it was meant to be used from — and nothing in `.env` could change that. The console gets its own bind knob because same-origin proxying means one port is enough: exposing AiSOC to a LAN no longer means handing out Postgres, Redis, Kafka and Neo4j with the development passwords this repository ships.
- **The console image a self-hoster pulls had fallen two releases behind `main`, and every workflow was green throughout.** `ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-web:latest` was built from a commit two releases old and `aisoc-web:v11.0.0` was never pushed at all, while `aisoc-core-api`, `aisoc-fusion` and `aisoc-ingest` all carried that tag. The cause was arm64 cross-building under QEMU: measured from BuildKit's own step timings, emulation cost roughly 7x on a good run and on a bad one did not converge — that release's arm64 `pnpm install` ran **6,358 seconds without finishing**, 56x its normal time, while the amd64 leg of the same build finished in 100s. Both publish workflows now build each architecture on a runner of that architecture and merge the two into a manifest list, and `publish-images.yml` no longer cancels itself mid-publish.
- **A green workflow says a job ran, not that the registry holds anything.** `scripts/check_published_images.py` resolves every image reference in `docker-compose.yml`, the Helm chart and tracked prose the way the tooling that reads them does, then asks GHCR. Against `main` before this change it reported 14 findings. It runs daily and over the output of every publish, so a half-published release now fails the run that half-published it.
- **The Helm chart could never have installed.** Every image tag defaults to `Chart.AppVersion`, which read `5.2.0` — a tag that exists for no image — so a default `helm install` could only reach `ImagePullBackOff` on every pod. The chart also named `ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-alert-fusion`, which has never existed, and set no upstream addresses on the web Deployment at all, so every console request in a cluster resolved nowhere and every panel stayed empty. `aisoc-honeytokens`, `aisoc-purple-team` and `aisoc-osquery-tls` are published for the first time in this release.
- **`make up` printed an address the operator could not use, and `make doctor` reported another deployment's health as yours.** `up` printed a hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` while the line two below it printed the configured address, contradicting each other on the one screen where a credential is handed over. `doctor` correctly reported which host port this project published and then probed the canonical one anyway — observed here reporting `ingest-worker ... cannot reach Kafka` while this deployment's own `/readyz` answered 200, because it was probing a different project's containers.
- **A recorded deployment walkthrough, and the written form of it.** Two minutes 57 seconds taking one host from nothing to an AI triage verdict, against the images published on GHCR, signed into at a LAN address rather than `localhost`. Everything in it is real: real images, real CISA KEV feed, real alert, real tokens, demo mode off and nothing seeded. Terminal waits are shortened and a badge says so on screen for the whole of every segment it applies to.

## v11.0.0 (2026-09-25)

`VERSION` was `11.0.0`. The **v11.0.0** release (2026-09-25) is what a first run actually produced. Most of it was found by bringing the stack up from the documented path and photographing the result, and nearly every item passed the existing test suite while failing on a real deployment.

**Read the BREAKING section of the changelog before upgrading.** Two items need action. `POST /v1/ingest` and `POST /v1/ingest/batch` now require a credential and take the tenant from it; previously they read `X-Tenant-ID`, believed it, and wrote alerts into whatever tenant the caller named. And CORE now needs **8 GB of memory and 20 GB of free disk**, up from `~6.5 GB`, because the threat-intelligence feed, its vector store and a local model moved into it.

**What is measured, and what is not.** A fresh `make up` now runs AI triage against the bundled `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` with no credentials. At the time this shipped the published figure was 7 schema-valid replies in a measured run of 19. **That figure does not reproduce**: re-measured later over 50 alerts through the gateway, on the same model and the same production call, it reads **44 of 50** — see `[11.2.0]` in `CHANGELOG.md` for the method and for the change that took it to 50 of 50. When validation fails, triage falls back to the deterministic path and logs that it did. That ratio is published here, in the README and on the architecture page rather than implied away. **No hosted provider has ever been exercised** — there is still no funded key, and that remains a separate, unmade claim. The npm and PyPI packages are built and packed on every tag and **are still not uploaded**, because no registry credential exists; treat any install command for them as unavailable rather than broken.

**v11.0.0 highlights (September 25, 2026)**
- **The ingest API authenticated nothing.** It read `X-Tenant-ID`, believed it, and wrote events for whatever tenant the caller named — so anyone who could reach the port could write alerts into any tenant. The comment in `server.go` asserting the endpoint was "token-authenticated per request" had been false since it was written. It is true now: a minted push token or a service token, with `X-Tenant-ID` intersected against what the credential authorises rather than trusted, and no dev-mode bypass.
- **Following the README broke the credential vault.** `.env.example` shipped a placeholder Fernet key and `cp .env.example .env` is step two of the quick start — but the vault only takes its ephemeral-development path when the key is *empty*, so a placeholder raised and every connector save returned HTTP 500. Not copying the template worked; following the instructions did not, and the failure surfaced minutes later at the connector wizard with nothing linking the two. `make up` now generates real secrets. The `make doctor` check meant to catch shipped placeholders matched neither placeholder the repository shipped.
- **`make up` could not succeed, ever.** Its wait loop scored any exited container as broken, and the one-shot model pull has always exited by the time `docker compose up -d` returns — so the step whose job is to say whether the stack is healthy reported the opposite on a completely healthy stack.
- **CORE had no real data and no AI.** The threat-intelligence service and its vector store lived in a profile nobody starting out runs, while the console shipped a page whose endpoint existed in no profile — the missing feed and a recent fabricated-IOC incident were one hole. A fresh `make up` now holds **1,723 real CISA KEV entries** within a minute of boot with no credentials, and Ollama moved in so triage produces real verdicts with real token counts. Along the way: a daily feed that would not have polled for 24 hours, and every auto-triage run on a default install being dead-lettered by a `NOT NULL` cost column.
- **The marketing site's only picture of the console was invented.** A hand-authored ledger with a named ransomware family, a confidence score, a dollar figure against a named hosted model — none of it labelled a mock, none of it ever having happened. It is replaced by four captures of a running CORE stack, two of them deliberately empty or degraded states. The "design partners" block and a testimonials section advertising a closed window were removed rather than updated, and the footer's hard-coded `v7.3.1` — shipped through seven major releases — now reads the version the release flow bumps.
- **Nothing in the console rendered the AI verdict.** The agents service triages every fused alert and writes the verdict, score and groundedness back onto the row; the API returned all four fields; the client dropped all four. The product's headline capability was producing tokens, cost and a ledger entry that no surface showed.

The full inventory — 83 entries, including what is knowingly still open — lives under `[11.0.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## v10.0.0 (2026-09-25)

`VERSION` was `10.0.0`. The **v10.0.0** release (2026-09-25) is an audit of a single shape: a control that exists, is tested, and sits on a path nothing reaches.

**Read the BREAKING section of the changelog before upgrading.** Every deployment must act on one item: services connect to Postgres as a DML-only `aisoc_app` role rather than as the schema owner, which is what makes the row-level-security policies filter. The bundled Postgres provisions it on a fresh volume; an existing volume or a managed database does not.

**v10.0.0 highlights (September 25, 2026)**
- **92 row-level-security policies filtered nothing.** Compose, CI, the Helm chart and the Terraform environment all ran every service as `POSTGRES_USER=aisoc`, which the postgres image creates as a superuser — and a superuser ignores policies even under `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`. Measured with one alert per tenant and the session bound to tenant A: the old role saw 2 rows, the new role sees 1.
- **Fifty-eight routes across four services carried no authentication at all.** Reproduced rather than inferred: an anonymous caller with no `Authorization` header created a playbook, listed all 64, **executed one**, deleted it, then read copilot conversations and ran a threat hunt. A further thirty routes let the caller name the tenant they were reading.
- **UEBA could never write a baseline or an anomaly, and reported healthy throughout.** Three schema defects on one code path, then a fourth: the baseline updater mutated a dict in place, so SQLAlchemy saw no change and left the column out of every `UPDATE`. Measured on a live stack — 36 events for one entity, all processed without error, the stored baseline frozen at `count: 1`.
- **AI triage could not reach a model, and it was not a missing key.** Compose set `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` on both services; both resolvers had been deliberately written to ignore it, so every `aisoc-<role>` alias went to a provider that cannot resolve one and the caller rendered that as "no LLM available". The gateway also moved from `full` into CORE, so a key now works with no profile change.
- **A new user who followed only the README could not log in** — the seeded address was rejected by the login route's own validator before the password was compared, and the committed hash matched no published credential. `make up` now creates an administrator and prints a generated password once.
- **Costs stopped being invented.** The tracker priced the `aisoc-<role>` *alias* against a table of hosted list prices it does not appear in, so every call fell through a default and a local completion that cost nothing was booked at `$0.000999` — a figure that reached the dashboard, the ledger and the budget circuit breaker. Every cost is now measured, labelled an estimate, or absent.

The full inventory — 188 entries — lives under `[10.0.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## v9.0.0 (2026-09-23)

`VERSION` was `9.0.0`. The **v9.0.0** release (2026-09-23) is ten waves of one audit question: what in this tree exists, is tested, and has no caller?

**v9.0.0 highlights (September 23, 2026)**
- **Approving an action executed nothing.** `decide()` flipped a row, notified the realtime service and returned 200 without ever touching `services/actions`. The other end was missing too — nothing in the repository ever created an approval, so the queue had no producer and was structurally empty on every deployment. A queue with no producer and a queue with no pending work look identical.
- **The confidence x impact approval matrix had zero production callers.** Written, documented, unit-tested and listed in the claim-to-gate matrix as GATED, while `POST /actions` gated on blast radius alone — a property of the verb, so the same answer came back for a 40%-confidence guess and a corroborated finding. Both gates run now and the stricter wins.
- **UEBA never scored a single message.** It consumed a topic nothing in the platform writes, so fusion's UEBA confidence boost — on by default, fully built — could only ever be inert.
- **A plugin could never be rejected for a bad signature.** `_get_registered_pub_key` returned `None` unconditionally, so verification was skipped entirely. The signing path existed end to end, had a CLI command, and was incapable of saying no. There was also no registry allow-list and no digest pinning, both of which the notes claimed existed.
- **The public scoreboard was frozen for ten weeks and every check passed**, because "freshness" meant the accuracy value was current and nothing ever read the row's date.
- **Neither published Go SDK was installable** — wrong case against a case-sensitive VCS path, missing the directory prefix — and **the Helm chart did not render** until dependencies were fetched, which no documentation mentioned.
- **A native responder app**, plus the honest correction that the responder console already existed as a PWA. The native app is a distribution channel; it exists because iOS Web Push requires an installed PWA and has been unreliable even then.

Packaging stops moving the number. It slipped v8.0 to v8.1 to v8.2 for the same reason each time, so the README states a fact rather than a date, and `check_published_packages.py` reads registry state so the claim cannot go stale in either direction.

The full inventory — including what is knowingly still open — lives under `[9.0.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## v8.1.1 (2026-09-23)

`VERSION` was `8.1.1`. The **v8.1.1** release (2026-09-23) adds no capability. It exists because an audit of how the repository is adopted — installability, architecture comprehension, data provenance, pipeline connectivity — found the quick start did not start the product.

**v8.1.1 highlights (September 23, 2026)**
- **The documented quick start never ran the product.** `./install.sh` handed off to a nine-service compose file with no ingest service, no fusion service, and `AISOC_DISABLE_KAFKA: true`. Everything visible in the console came from `seed_demo.py` writing fifteen fabricated incidents straight into Postgres, and the installer printed "AiSOC is up and running" because the compose command exited 0. It now runs `make up` — the same CORE stack the README documents and CI tests — then proves the pipeline before claiming success.
- **`make smoke` is the claim.** One real event enters ingest, travels Kafka and fusion, matches a detection, and is read back from the API, with each of the eight stages reporting independently so a break names the boundary. It reaches past nothing: no stubbed Kafka, no inserted alert. CI fails if any stage does, and separately verifies the gate fails when the pipeline is broken.
- **`services/ingest` answered `/health` unconditionally**, so "ingest is healthy" and "every event is being dropped" could both be true at once — exactly the state a broker outage produces. `/readyz` now dials Kafka; verified live at 200 up and 503 down, with a reason and the log command to run.
- **CORE is the default: ten services, roughly 6 GB**, and it is the smallest deployment that turns a real event into a real alert rather than a cut-down toy. ClickHouse, Neo4j, Qdrant, OpenSearch, enrichment and connectors moved to `full`. OpenSearch is started by `full` and read by nothing, and is recorded that way instead of appearing in a diagram.
- **Five surfaces rendered fabricated data outside demo mode** — the MSSP overview, the Copilot's reply on API error, the air-gap status endpoint, an analyst identity in Settings, and the investigation timeline. All are gated now and return honest empties otherwise.
- **Three of the eight publishable packages could not be built.** The v8.1.0 tag surfaced it, which is the credential-gated build design working: an unresolvable workspace dependency for `aisoc` and `@aisoc/mcp`, and a duplicate-path wheel failure for `aisoc-cli`. Both would have blocked the first real publish.

`make doctor`, `docs/audit/REPOSITORY_REALITY.md`, a data-flow rewrite of `docs/architecture/README.md`, and `docs/testing/CLEAN_INSTALL.md` came out of the same pass. The full inventory lives under `[8.1.1]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## v8.1.0 (2026-09-23)

`VERSION` was `8.1.0`. The **v8.1.0** release (2026-09-23) delivers the wave-2 backlog and the defects auditing it surfaced.

**v8.1.0 highlights (September 23, 2026)**
- **A ChatOps approval authorized nobody.** The Slack and Teams bots verified who clicked — Slack signs every interaction payload, Teams payloads carry an HMAC — recorded that person in an audit event, and then called the actions service with no approver. The permission-tier check and separation of duties were both skipped. A bot cannot supply permissions (it knows a Slack user id and has no idea what that person may do in AiSOC), so it now asserts identity only and the actions service maps it through operator configuration. **If you use ChatOps approvals you must populate `AISOC_CHATOPS_APPROVERS` or they will be refused** — that is the intended failure.
- **The signed email-approval fallback linked to a 404.** `approval_url()` pointed at a path no router served, so the documented answer to "Slack is unreachable" failed at the moment it was needed. The route exists, and the recipient is signed into the token, because a bare signed link is a bearer credential that approves as nobody.
- **The API service had no LLM input contract at all.** Seven endpoints POSTed untrusted input straight to a provider, including a submitted email body. The rules are now shared with `services/agents` rather than reimplemented, and the no-bypass gate — which walked the AST for `.ainvoke`/`.astream` and so could not see a raw-HTTP call — has a second half.
- **One `not` rule silently discarded a tenant's entire business-context rule set** at triage, suppressions included, because two evaluators disagreed about whether `not` takes a mapping or a list.
- **A rule id named one rule in the engine and a different one in the catalogue** for 45 network rules, so an analyst looking up an id off an alert read the wrong rule's description and playbook.
- **First-run fixes.** The Codespaces quickstart could never start Docker (capabilities are granted at container creation and cannot be self-granted from an image), and service images were published amd64-only, so Apple Silicon could not pull a single one.

Packaging moves to **v8.2**. The blocker is registry credentials, not code — `release.yml` already builds, packs and would upload all eight packages — and a release cannot schedule an account action by writing a version number.

The full inventory lives under `[8.1.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## v8.0.0 (2026-09-22)

`VERSION` was `8.0.0`. The **v8.0.0** release (2026-09-22) is the **Close the loop** release. v8.0 had been reserved for the package-publish milestone; nothing can publish without registry credentials, so the milestone was re-scoped and distribution/packaging moved out. What v8.0 does instead is close the gap between what the codebase contains and what it actually runs.

**v8.0.0 highlights (September 22, 2026)**
- **The finding worth remembering, because it repeated a dozen times:** the mechanism existed, was unit-tested, and had no caller on the path that needed it. A passing test on an uncalled function is indistinguishable from a working feature until someone traces the call graph. `evidence_fingerprint` promised volatile fields were excluded while its only caller hashed the alert row id plus the whole raw event, so no two alerts ever matched and v7.7's repeat-alert suppression could only ever report zero. `PostActionVerifier` had no caller, and its isolation probe returned `bool(device_id)` — it would have certified an uncontained host. The console wrote per-tenant L0–L4 autonomy tiers to Postgres while the dispatcher read one global environment variable. `get_entity_neighbors` accepted a `tenant_id` and never passed it to the driver.
- **Fabricated security data across 24 components.** The `AlertDetailView` catch block rendered a full invented verdict — named IP, C2 domain, "12 additional systems" — as `status: 'completed'`. `/hunt/search` always returned synthetic telemetry behind a green "Live backend" pill. All seeded and mock data is now gated behind demo mode, with honest empty, zero and error states otherwise, enforced by a new `check_mock_data_gated.py` gate.
- **Three services were fully unauthenticated** — `purple-team` (20 routes), `honeytokens` (9) and `ueba` (7) — and so was the live-action router. Default-deny landed on all four.
- **Securing the customer's AI estate** as the flagship capability: a new `ai` connector category, an `ai_gateway` connector, two ingest webhook templates mapping to OCSF `6003` and `2001`, a dependency-free SDK that hashes prompts by default while still reporting which secret shapes they contained, eight executable AI-runtime detections, and AiSOC's own MCP server as the first monitored asset.

## v7.7.0 (2026-08-04)

`VERSION` was `7.7.0`. Seven gap-closing waves, each its own PR: detection **backtesting** (`POST /rules/{id}/backtest` replays a candidate rule over real tenant-scoped lake events and reports honest `would_fire` / `hit_rate`); three **detection-authoring modes** (a Python `def rule(event)` framework with a fixture gate, an AI builder that turns natural language into Sigma plus auto-derived fixtures through the eval gate into a governed proposal, and a no-code builder); **invoking-identity least-privilege** scoping for response actions, so the authenticated principal replaces free-text `requested_by` and nobody approves their own action; self-service **data lifecycle** (per-tenant retention, a ReDoS-proof grok transform DSL, runtime custom parsers); an agentless **CSPM** scanner plus compliance auto-evidence and SSRF-guarded destinations; and a customisable **report builder**. Wave 1 wired components that existed but were never connected: auto-triage outcomes persist as per-signature institutional-memory priors, and a repeat alert matching a *trusted* prior benign disposition is auto-resolved without re-triage — human priors trusted immediately, AI priors needing corroboration, a prior true positive never auto-closing. Full inventory under `[7.7.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## v7.6.0 (2026-07-13)

`VERSION` was `7.6.0`. The **v7.6.0** release (2026-07-13) is the **Fully-Operational AI-SOC** release — it completes the A1–E1 roadmap that made the platform work end-to-end and pushed it to competitive parity + beyond.

**v7.6.0 highlights (July 13, 2026)**
- **Phase A — the data spine flows.** A ClickHouse lake writer populates `aisoc.raw_events` from the stream (A1); a live detection-evaluation worker runs the 947-rule executable corpus against every event and emits alerts (A2); a cold `docker compose up` now ships connectors + graph-at-ingest by default, proven by an extended integration gate (A3); and the UEBA behavioral model is fused into alert scoring, making the three-model story real (A4).
- **Phase B — autonomous triage + real response.** Every fused alert is auto-triaged off the Kafka stream (copilot/read-only default) (B1); a credential resolver maps connector `auth_config` to executor params and the Phase 9a autonomy `decide()` now governs the live dispatch path, with 10 previously-unregistered vendor adapters wired (B2); rollback makes real reverse vendor calls with post-action verification and durable approval-SLA timers (B3); and Business Context Rules run on the post-fusion → pre-triage hot path (B4).
- **Phase C — parity differentiators.** Advanced Data Explorer (unified NL + SQL over the lake) (C1); Effective-Permissions resolves against a live posture snapshot collected via connector `get_resource_config` (C2); an autopilot/copilot autonomy scorecard defaulting to copilot (C3); and fuse-time attack-chain auto-grouping so related alerts collapse into one ordered incident (C4).
- **Phase D — breadth.** Eight new connectors — IBM QRadar, Exabeam, Securonix, Devo, Netskope, Windows/Sysmon (WEF), Zeek/Suricata NDR, and a generic syslog/CEF listener (D1); an AI/LLM-usage audit connector + eight `llm-*` detections + hot/cold ClickHouse lake tiering (D2); and a live-vendor mock-server smoke suite that exercises each connector's real HTTP client (D3).
- **Phase E — prove it.** The public benchmark scoreboard is now CI-gated against a deterministic live-agent MITRE-accuracy run, closing the last `NO GATE` and ratcheting `MAX_NO_GATE` to 0 (E1).

The full inventory (every file, env-var, and test count) lives under `[7.6.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). Note that the claim-to-gate figure quoted in the v7.6.0 announcement (33 GATED / 7 PARTIAL) was the count at that time; the matrix has grown since — recount with `python3 scripts/check_claim_gate_matrix.py` rather than reading a number off this line.

## v7.5.0 (2026-06-29)

`VERSION` was `7.5.0`. The **v7.5.0** release (2026-06-29) is a v8.0-milestone and trust-readiness release. It tags the `AiSOC missing pieces — Phases 1–5` rollup ([PR #337](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/337); 25 commits, 188 files, +23 743 / -907), the four named v8.0 milestones (T3.7 NL→playbook, T3.8 design system v2 + Storybook, T4 wave-3 marketplace + 6 hardened connectors, T5.3 fidelity loaders), the marketing-shell unification on `tryaisoc.com`, the threat-actor attribution RBAC + port fix, the realtime short-lived-ticket auth, the boundary-aware KB chunker, the Terraform CI workflow + the three missing reusable infra modules (`rds`, `elasticache`, `kafka`), and a large Dependabot + security sweep — every change that landed on `main` since `7.4.0`. The full inventory lives under `[7.5.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

**v7.5.0 highlights (June 29, 2026)**
- **AiSOC missing pieces — Phases 1–5 rollup** ([PR #337](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/337)): trust-critical honesty fixes on `/sovereign` + Features + README, CI matrix expanded to 7 previously-untested Python services (~971 new test signals), coverage gates, real SOAR executors for SentinelOne EDR / PAN-OS / FortiGate / Cloudflare WAF + DNS / Splunk ES / Elastic / MDE / Entra ID / Google Workspace, real `CreateTicketExecutor` wired to Jira / ServiceNow / PagerDuty, Azure/GCP/Okta/GWS effective-permissions resolvers, managed-mode auto-provision pipeline (`infra/fly/managed/`), CI-built white-paper PDFs + 90 s Playwright screencast, the deterministic NL → ES|QL / KQL / SPL translator (**81-case eval at 100 % syntactic + 100 % semantic**), real-browser visual regression, a buyer-journey E2E, and four immutable ADRs (`docs/decisions/0001`–`0004`).
- **v8.0 milestones** — T3.7 NL → playbook generator ([#330](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/330)); T3.8 design system v2 + Storybook ([#331](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/331), restored `DraftFromPromptDialog` story in [#335](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/335), Storybook publicDir fix in [#336](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/336)); T4 wave-3 marketplace + 6 hardened connectors ([#333](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/333), wave-1 parity hardening in [#328](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/328)); T5.3 AIT-LDS + MITRE Engenuity fidelity loaders ([#332](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/332)).
- **Threat-actor attribution — port fix + optional RBAC.** The investigation agent's default `AISOC_THREATINTEL_URL` was `http://threatintel:8083`; the service binds **8005** — every `POST /api/v1/actors/attribute` therefore hit a port nothing listens on and silently degraded. Default corrected, docs + `AISOC_ATTRIBUTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` aligned, regression test added ([#327](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/327)). Same release ships an opt-in shared-secret gate on `/api/v1/actors/*` ([#329](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/329)): when `AISOC_THREATINTEL_SERVICE_TOKEN` is set, callers must present `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (constant-time compared, `401` on mismatch); when unset, the legacy unauthenticated behaviour is preserved and a startup warning is logged.
- **Marketing-shell unification on `tryaisoc.com`.** Every `/(marketing)` page plus the standalone `/not-found`, `/why-open-source`, and `/benchmark` routes now renders the same `StickyNav` + `sections/Footer` shell; the older simpler `LandingNav.tsx` and `landing/Footer.tsx` were deleted, eleven marketing pages had their per-page nav/footer JSX + imports removed, `(marketing)/layout.tsx` centrally injects the shell, and `StickyNav`'s anchors were absolutised so they resolve identically from the landing page and from any subpage.
- **Knowledge-base ingest — boundary-aware chunking with overlap** ([#321](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/321), closes [#277](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/277)). KB ingestion no longer splits mid-sentence or mid-code-fence; the new chunker prefers paragraph / sentence / code-block boundaries and applies a configurable overlap so retrieval doesn't lose context across chunks.
- **Realtime — WS/SSE authenticated via short-lived tickets** ([#246](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/246), closes [#239](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/239)). The realtime service's WebSocket and SSE endpoints now require a short-lived signed ticket that the API mints for the authenticated session, closing the unauthenticated fan-out surface that lived between `services/realtime` and `apps/web`.
- **Infrastructure — Terraform CI + missing core modules.** A Terraform workflow gates every change to `infra/terraform/**` with `init`/`validate`/`fmt -check` ([#251](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/251)). The three reusable modules the AWS and BYOC references were already importing — `rds`, `elasticache`, `kafka` — are now actually present in `infra/terraform/modules/` ([#252](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/252)) so a fresh `terraform init` against the multi-cloud skeletons no longer errors on missing sources.
- **Dependency & CI maintenance.** ~15 Dependabot landings including `next` 16.2.7 → 16.2.9, `framer-motion` 11 → 12.40.0, `cryptography` updates across services, FastAPI updates in `services/{api,actions,agents}`, `actions/checkout` v6 → v7; `aiohttp` 3.14.1 clears CVE-2026-34993 + CVE-2026-47265 ([#295](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/295)); pnpm audit high/critical findings cleared ([#322](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/322)) so the dep-bump queue could merge; a duplicate `@mdx-js/react` key that was breaking `pnpm install` on fresh clones removed ([#296](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/296)).

**Previously, in v7.4.0 (May 29, 2026)** — security-hardening and platform release that tagged the May 27–29 hardening wave, multi-agent routing, and the multi-cloud infrastructure skeletons that had accumulated on `main` since `7.3.1`. The full inventory lives under `[7.4.0]` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
- **Security hardening** — prompt-injection sanitizer wired into the classification agents; cross-tenant isolation enforced on detection-loop suggestions and the compliance / phishing / knowledge-base endpoints; a nightly cross-tenant RBAC regression gate; `cryptography` CVEs cleared and CodeQL quality notes resolved.
- **Multi-agent routing** — `DetectAgent.process` wired to the `FusionEngine` over cross-service HTTP; `/investigate` routed through the `RouterOrchestrator` behind the `ROUTER_INVESTIGATE` flag; a Redis-backed scheduler singleton guard for in-process workers.
- **Multi-cloud infrastructure** — serverless-container Terraform skeletons for GCP (Cloud Run + Cloud SQL + Memorystore) and Azure (Container Apps + PostgreSQL Flexible Server + Cache for Redis), mirroring the AWS/EKS reference file-for-file.
- **Live dashboard & landing** — real `/metrics` data restored on `tryaisoc.com/dashboard`, API/agents machines kept warm so the dashboard no longer 500s, seed timestamps re-anchored so it never goes empty, and the landing CTAs pointed at the live dashboard.
- **Dependency & CI maintenance** — a large Dependabot sweep across the Python, JS, and Go services plus CI stabilization (Ruff cleanup, OpenAPI export permissions, lockfile dedupe).

**Hardening detail folded into v7.4.0 (May 27–28, 2026)**
- **Security Audit green** — `cryptography` floor raised to `44.0.1` to clear CVE-2024-12797 and later 42.x advisories across `services/connectors` and `services/osquery-tls`; advisories without an upstream fix are time-boxed (90-day expiry) in [`scripts/security_audit_ignores.txt`](scripts/security_audit_ignores.txt) ([#229](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/229)).
- **Tenant-isolation fix** — detection-loop suggestion lookups are now scoped to the caller's tenant, closing a cross-tenant read path ([#221](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/221)).
- **Full stack boots clean** — the reserved `window` column is now quoted and `pydantic[email]` ships in the image, so `docker compose` comes up end-to-end without manual patching ([#227](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/227)).
- **OpenAPI auto-export unblocked** — the spec-export CI job now has `contents: write`, so the committed OpenAPI document re-syncs on every merge ([#228](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/228)).
- **CodeQL quality notes cleared** — remaining low-severity CodeQL findings resolved on `main` ([#224](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/224)).
- **Dependency refresh** — `zod` 3 → 4.4.3 ([#225](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/225)), `recharts` 2 → 3.8.1 ([#209](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/209)), plus a Dependabot sweep across `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `structlog`, `openai`, `weasyprint`, `strawberry-graphql`, `prometheus-client`, `go-chi`, `turbo`, and `@types/react`.
- **Credits** — new Credits section thanking contributors and security researchers ([#223](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/223)).

**Console workbenches (v1.5 PR-1 → PR-6)** — the SOC operator surface is now a workbench, not a list.
- **Global time-window selector + topbar context** — one selector at the top of the console drives every page (Alerts, Cases, Hunts, Funnel KPIs, Pipeline Health). Persists across reloads, deep-linkable as a URL param.
- **Tenant switcher + role badge** — MSSP operators flip tenants from the topbar; the role badge makes it impossible to confuse a `viewer` session with an `admin` session. New endpoint: `GET /api/v1/tenants/me/identity`.
- **Critical severity tier** — the severity ladder is now `info | low | medium | high | critical`. Vendor-native criticals (Azure 5-tier, GCP SCC, GitHub `critical`, ServiceNow priority 1, GuardDuty ≥ 8.0, AuditD identity-destruction, K8s `cluster-admin`, Tailscale tailnet lockdown) map straight through instead of being collapsed into `high`. Confidence (`alert.confidence`, 0–100, band `low|medium|high`) is now decoupled from severity and emitted by `services/fusion` `ConfidenceScorer`.
- **Operations funnel + pipeline health** — new `/metrics/funnel` and `/health/pipeline` endpoints feed the `FunnelKpiBar` (Detected → Triaged → Investigated → Resolved) and an Efficiency Report so SOC leads can answer "where are we losing time?" without a Grafana detour. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md).
- **Investigation Rail (W6 / PR-4)** — `/alerts` is now a two-pane workbench with narrative, related entities (`pivotPath` deep links), 6-event mini-timeline, and structured recommended actions. Fusion writes a deterministic correlation narrative at fuse time. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/investigation-rail.md).
- **Investigation Queue workbench (PR-5 / W7)** — `/queue` is the page a Tier-1 analyst lives on: server-anchored SLA countdowns, atomic claim semantics, one-click triage actions. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/queue.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/queue.md).
- **Rule Tuning workbench (PR-6 / W8)** — `/detection/tuning` ranks noisy rules by precision impact and ships one-click suppression + allow-list edits with full audit trail. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/rule-tuning.md).
- **Zero-prerequisite installer** — `install.sh` / `install.ps1` now bootstrap from a clean machine (Docker, Compose, Node, pnpm, Python) with idempotency and a graduated `uninstall.sh`. Documented in [`apps/docs/docs/installation.md`](apps/docs/docs/installation.md), surfaced as **Path 0** in the [quickstart](apps/docs/docs/quickstart.md).

**Architectural foundation (PR [#125](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/125))** — the graph-at-ingest and four-agent groundwork now on `main`.
- **Graph at ingest** — Neo4j entity graph (17 node labels, 14 edge types) written inline with Kafka consumption. Batched UNWIND upserts + fire-and-forget retry queue keep ingest latency budget intact. Schema doc: [`apps/docs/docs/architecture/graph-schema.md`](apps/docs/docs/architecture/graph-schema.md).
- **Four-agent rebrand** — `DetectAgent`, `TriageAgent`, `HuntAgent`, `RespondAgent` are now the public façade; back-compat aliases preserve existing imports. Funnel KPI doc: [`apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md`](apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md).
- **`/hunt` natural-language surface** — type a hypothesis in English, get ES|QL / SPL / KQL templates back, save and schedule the hunt. HuntAgent never writes raw queries. Saved hunts deep-link into the Investigation Rail via `pivotPath`.
- **Sixteen first-party connectors** — wave-1 (`tines`, `torq`, `falco`, `pagerduty`, `opsgenie`, `confluence_audit`) and wave-2 fixtures (`cloudflare_zt`, `sysdig`, `vault`, `snowflake`). Five severity tiers preserved end-to-end.
- **L0–L4 automation maturity model** — [`apps/docs/docs/concepts/automation-maturity.md`](apps/docs/docs/concepts/automation-maturity.md) plus the marketing surfaces. Ladder: L0 manual → L4 fully autonomous closure with human sign-off.
- **Public weekly benchmark scoreboard** — [`apps/docs/docs/benchmark-scoreboard.mdx`](apps/docs/docs/benchmark-scoreboard.mdx) reads `apps/docs/static/data/scoreboard.json`, refreshed weekly by `.github/workflows/wet-eval.yml`. Substrate rows are visually separated from wet-eval rows — substrate numbers can never be quoted as live agent performance.

**Security & correctness wave** — 12 critical/high CVE-class fixes that landed ahead of v7.4.0. See [`apps/docs/docs/operations/security.md`](apps/docs/docs/operations/security.md) for the full inventory.
- Rule-engine `eval()` RCE eliminated — conditions are parsed to a whitelisted AST in [`services/api/app/services/rules_engine.py`](services/api/app/services/rules_engine.py) ([#116](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/116)).
- `/hunts` and `/cases` tenant isolation enforced at the **query layer** (`WHERE tenant_id = …`), not via RLS alone ([#117](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/117), [#118](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/118)).
- CORS lockdown — a shared `cors.py` is vendored byte-identical into every Python service and refuses to start with `*` + credentials in production ([#119](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/119)).
- Playbook SSRF guard — every outbound `http_request` / `notify` runs through [`services/agents/app/playbook/ssrf_guard.py`](services/agents/app/playbook/ssrf_guard.py) with a cloud-metadata block list ([#120](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/120)).
- Plugin-manager OCI install hardening — signed manifests verified against an allow-list, image digests pinned and re-verified on every load ([#121](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/121)).
- Audit-log integrity (H-4 + M-12) — `actor_ip` spoofing closed via the new `TRUSTED_PROXIES` allow-list, secrets stripped from `changes`, hash-chain tamper-proofing ([#122](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/122)).
- `/alerts/submit` abuse + replay hardening — payload caps (events / per-event bytes / total bytes), `Idempotency-Key` header, recursive `raw_event` redaction, timestamp clamping ([#123](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/123)).
- Pydantic v1 → v2 settings migration ([#124](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/124)), bounded `eval()` + playbook timeouts ([#126](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/126)), one-flag dev-mode (`AISOC_DEV_MODE` — supersedes `DEV_MODE` / `SKIP_AUTH` / `AISOC_DEMO_MODE`, [#127](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/127)), untrusted-enrichment sanitisation before LLM ([#128](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/128)).
- Python CodeQL alert count on `main` driven to zero ([#133](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/133), [#136](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/136), [#137](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/137)); enforced as a CI gate going forward.
- First community contribution merged: [#135](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/135) (UEBA env-var alignment, closes [#134](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/issues/134)). Every UEBA variable accepts both unprefixed (`DATABASE_URL`) and legacy (`UEBA_DATABASE_URL`) forms; unprefixed wins.

**Stage 2 / Stage 3 platform additions** — landed alongside the architectural foundation above.
- **Wazuh Indexer ingest connector** — polls `wazuh-alerts-*` over HTTPX, paginates time-windowed queries, retries on 5xx; collapses Wazuh severity into the AiSOC ladder. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/connectors/wazuh.md`](apps/docs/docs/connectors/wazuh.md). The connector registry now declares **84 first-party connectors**.
- **auditd `file_tail` connector + `aisoc.rules` profile** — replaces the host-agent dependency for Linux endpoint visibility; 4 new detections pivot on the bundled `aisoc_*` audit keys. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/connectors/auditd.md`](apps/docs/docs/connectors/auditd.md).
- **Live Actions dispatcher** — generic vendor/capability surface so plugins can register executors against the in-tree taxonomy (`isolate_host`, `disable_user`, `block_ip`, …) without forking. Unknown pairs return a typed `LiveActionResult(FAILED, "executor_not_found")` — never a 500. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md`](apps/docs/docs/concepts/live-actions.md).
- **Deterministic NL → ES|QL / KQL / SPL translator** — replaces the template fallback in `/nl_query` with an IR + grammar validator; 50-pair gold eval set scores 100% syntactic, 100% semantic. Air-gapped by default; optional `gpt-4o-mini` enhancement falls back deterministically.
- **STIX → MISP push** — every STIX 2.1 indicator/bundle published through `/api/v1/threatintel/stix/...` can now be mirrored into the configured MISP instance. Air-gap gated, with a `?push_to_misp=true` query param and a dry-run endpoint for air-gapped audits. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md`](apps/docs/docs/integrations/misp-push.md).
- **GCP Cloud Run + Cloud SQL Terraform skeleton** — serverless-first BYOC equivalent of the existing AWS module. One `terraform apply` stands AiSOC up on GCP with private-IP networking, Secret Manager, and Artifact Registry. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md`](apps/docs/docs/deployment/gcp.md).
- **Azure Container Apps + Postgres Flexible Server Terraform skeleton** — file-for-file mirror of the GCP skeleton for teams standardised on Azure. Container Apps for the three customer-visible services, VNet-integrated Postgres 16 + Azure Cache for Redis on private endpoints, Key Vault for secrets, ACR for images, and per-service user-assigned managed identities so each app pulls its own image and reads only its own secrets. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/deployment/azure.md`](apps/docs/docs/deployment/azure.md).
- **Blameless case post-mortem endpoint** — `GET /api/v1/cases/{case_id}/postmortem?format=json|html` produces a deterministic retrospective covering contributing factors, detection timing/gaps, response phases, blast radius, and action items. Analyst handles are explicitly redacted from the narrative. Docs: [`apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md`](apps/docs/docs/operations/case-reports.md).
- **Per-rule cross-fire FP gate** — `services/agents/tests/test_detection_fp_rate.py` replays every rule's `match_when` against every *other* rule's positive fixture; current corpus 816 native rules, worst FPR 0.49% (5% ceiling). Wired into `scripts/run_evals.py` as `suites.detection_fp_rate`.
- **Operator-facing documentation refresh** — new pages for [notifications](apps/docs/docs/operations/notifications.md), [plugin lifecycle](apps/docs/docs/plugins/lifecycle.md), and [credentials / vault rotation](apps/docs/docs/operations/credentials.md); v2.2 architecture diagram and the corrected **84-connector count** (now including Wazuh Indexer + auditd `file_tail`) rolled through every surface.

The full inventory (with file paths, env-var changes, and test counts) lives in the `[7.4.0]` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
