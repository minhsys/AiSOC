# Security batch progress

Thirteen defects found by reading the code at `v14.0.0` (commit `079fdb6`). None
had been exercised against a running deployment, so every item starts with a
reproduction that fails on the untouched tree for the stated reason.

Two of the thirteen are also items in
[`plans/aisoc_parity_plan.plan.md`](plans/aisoc_parity_plan.plan.md). They are
done once, here, and the parity tracker points at this file rather than
repeating the work.

## D0. This batch is public, by the maintainer's decision

The source brief specified coordinated disclosure: a local branch pushed
nowhere, a tracker under `.private/`, and advisory drafts handed over in chat
for the maintainer to publish before any code became visible.

The maintainer chose the opposite: ordinary public pull requests, merged and
released as they land, with advisories filed afterwards against the release.
The reasoning is that this is a self-hosted product whose defaults are readable
by anyone who opens `.env.example`, so the fix reaching self-hosters sooner is
worth more than the delay buying secrecy that the repository does not really
have.

What that changes, and what it does not:

- No `.private/` directory. This file is the tracker and it is committed.
- Commit messages stay neutral and carry no exploit detail, payloads or
  advisory wording. That costs nothing, keeps the history readable, and leaves
  the option of filing advisories against these commits later.
- Advisory drafts are still produced for every defect: reproduction, root
  cause, affected versions, a suggested CVSS v3.1 vector, and whether the fix
  is breaking.
- S1 and S13 both break callers, so this batch lands as a major.

## Pre-existing state, captured before any code was written

Measured on `origin/main` at `079fdb69` with the working tree stashed, so the
numbers describe the untouched tree.

### Gates: 77 of 84 pass

The seven that do not, and why none is a defect in the tree:

| Gate | Exit | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `check_attribution.py` | 2 | Refuses to scan without `--all`, `--diff-base`, `--commits` or `--text-file`. |
| `check_container_egress.py` | 2 | Refuses without `--service`: "a probe that covers nothing must not report clean". |
| `check_published_secrets.py` | 2 | Refuses without `--check-env`, `--check` or `--list-guarded`. |
| `check_codeql_alerts.py` | 2 | Needs `GITHUB_TOKEN` with `security-events: read`. Refuses rather than reporting clean about alerts it never read. |
| `check_main_run_cancellations.py` | 2 | Needs a token for the Actions API, same refusal. |
| `check_required_check_substance.py` | 2 | Needs a token for the Actions API, same refusal. |
| `check_mypy_baseline.py` | 1 | Environmental, see D14. |

Six of the seven are the gate contract working: they decline to render a
verdict about a corpus they could not read. Only `check_mypy_baseline` reports
a finding, and it does not reproduce in CI.

### Console suite

`apps/web`: 79 files, 816 tests, zero failures. `npx tsc --noEmit` clean.
`npx eslint .` reports 0 errors and 76 warnings, all pre-existing.

## Deviations: where the brief and the tree disagree

### D1. S1c is 61 call sites, not 27

The brief names `RBACView.tsx` and "any other header-less call you find".
Counting by hand with a grep for `fetch('/api/v1` gives 27. The gate written
for the item finds **61** across 21 files, and the extra 34 are not noise:

- template-literal URLs behind a base variable, which the grep pattern cannot
  see: `fetch(\`${API}/api/v1/honeytokens/${id}\`)` on the honeytokens and
  purple-team pages (9 calls);
- six calls inside `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` itself, five of which sent
  `X-Tenant-Id` and no token, which reads like an identity and is not one;
- sixteen `useSWR` sites whose fetcher is a single-argument function and
  therefore anonymous by construction.

### D2. `require_permission_db` has 27 call sites, not 31

All 27 are in-body `await <principal>.require_permission_db(...)`; there are
**zero** as a `Depends`. They live in four modules only: `autonomy_policy.py`
(9), `tenant_skills.py` (9), `business_context.py` (5), `mcp_servers.py` (4).
The static figure in the brief is exact: 272, being 256 `Depends` plus 16
direct calls.

### D3. S3's "no authorization decision" is narrower than written

All four routes in `services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/shifts.py` do take
`current_user: AuthUser`, so they authenticate. What is absent is any
`require_permission(...)` and any tenant scoping, so the finding is
cross-tenant read and write of one shared in-process list by any authenticated
principal. The effect stands; the mechanism in the brief does not.

### D4. S7's audit-read restriction is not a wildcard check

`services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/audit.py` contains no `"*"` comparison.
Both read routes use `Depends(require_permission("audit_log:read"))`. The
outcome the brief describes holds and is stronger than stated: `audit_log:read`
appears in **no** role's permission list in `ROLE_PERMISSIONS`, so only the two
roles holding `["*"]` can read the log. A `tenant_admin` gets 403 because the
permission is unreachable, not because a wildcard was demanded.

### D5. The production compose file already exists and nothing selects it

S1's fix is not "write a production compose". `docker-compose.prod.yml` sets
`ENVIRONMENT: production` and `AISOC_DEV_MODE: 0` as literals on all six Python
services. But `Makefile:102` (`up:`) and `Makefile:142` (`up-full:`) never pass
`-f docker-compose.prod.yml`, and `install.sh` and `install.ps1` contain zero
occurrences of either variable. The file is correct and unreachable from every
documented path.

### D6. `realtime`'s push routes are worse than written

The brief says the tenant comes "from a header or query parameter with no
credential". `services/realtime/src/push.ts:92` reads `x-tenant-id`, falls back
to the `tenant_id` query parameter, and then falls back to the literal string
`'default'`. The three `POST /v1/push/*` routes carry only a rate limiter.

### D7. Ten services default `AISOC_DEV_MODE=1`, and `api` is not one of them

`docker-compose.yml` sets `AISOC_DEV_MODE: ${AISOC_DEV_MODE:-1}` on fusion,
agents, osquery-tls, actions, connectors, threatintel, ueba, honeytokens,
purple-team and slack-bot. The API service has no `AISOC_DEV_MODE` at all; it
reaches the same bypass through `ENVIRONMENT: ${ENVIRONMENT:-development}` and
`AUTH_BYPASS_ENVIRONMENTS`.

### D14. `check_mypy_baseline` fails locally and passes in CI

Locally it reports `(unmanaged)/scripts/run_evals.py: 15 index finding(s),
baseline records 13`. CI is green at the same commit (28 success, 2 skipped on
`079fdb69`), and the local mypy is 2.3.1, which is what `ci.yml:234` pins.

The gate deliberately removes two sources of variance with
`--no-site-packages --no-incremental`, documented at `ci.yml:272`. It does not
pin the interpreter, and this machine runs Python 3.12.6 against CI's 3.11.
Recorded as environmental rather than fixed, and worth noting as a gap in a
gate whose whole purpose is reproducibility.

## S1. Anonymous admin in the documented deployment

Reproduced and confirmed live on `origin/main`. The crux is byte-identical, not
merely similar: `dev_auth.py:29` `DEMO_TENANT_ID` and `bootstrap_admin.py:59`
`DEFAULT_TENANT_ID` are both `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`, so the
anonymous principal is an `admin` in the same tenant the real operator is
bootstrapped into.

- [x] **S1c** Console credential on every call ([#1069](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/1069))
- [x] **S1a** The bypass needs an explicit opt-in, refuses a reachable bind address, and the demo
      identity has its own tenant ([#1070](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/1072))
- [x] **S1b** The nine vendored shims, the three `require_service_auth` copies, slack-bot and
      realtime push ([#1070](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/1072))
- [x] **S1d** Production-class defaults on every documented path ([#1073](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/pull/1074))

## S2 to S13

- [ ] **S2** Copilot conversations and saved hunt searches are tenant-scoped
- [ ] **S3** Fabricated shared shift state
- [ ] **S4** STIX and TAXII demo data served outside demo mode
- [ ] **S5** Login throttling and lockout
- [ ] **S6** SSO stub identities deleted
- [ ] **S7** Audit blind spots
- [ ] **S8** Tenant isolation beyond query predicates
- [ ] **S9** State-changing routes with no authorization decision
- [ ] **S10** Attacker-controlled alert text can close and then silence alerts
- [ ] **S11** Plaintext service traffic
- [ ] **S12** Default Caldera API key
- [ ] **S13** A custom role cannot restrict a user below their built-in role

## Maintainer actions

- [ ] Check whether the managed instance runs with a dev-class `ENVIRONMENT`
      or serves more than one real tenant. If it does, assess exposure for S1
      to S4 and rotate anything those routes could reach. (Named neutrally on
      purpose: `scripts/check_hosted_hostname.py` keeps the managed hostname
      out of this repository, and a tracker is not a reason to exempt it.)
- [ ] Reserve the PyPI and npm names the packages will use (`aisoc` on PyPI
      belongs to an unrelated project).
- [ ] File the advisories against the release once the batch has landed.

### D9. Flipping the default to production stops the API booting, until two more secrets exist

Found by starting the stack, not by a test. `enforce_secure_defaults` refuses
to boot when `METRICS_TOKEN` or `JWT_SECRET` is empty and the environment is
not development-class, and `ensure_env.py` generated neither, because in a
development-class environment that check only warns. So the posture change on
its own would have turned "anonymous administrator" into "the API will not
start". Both are generated now, taking `make env` from twelve secrets to
fourteen.

Two adjacent defects surfaced in the same hour, both of the same shape as one
this repository has hit before — a value in `.env` that cannot reach the
container that needs it:

* neither secret was declared on the `api` service in `docker-compose.yml`, so
  generating them was not sufficient;
* `ingest-worker` hardcoded `JWT_SECRET: dev_secret_key_change_in_production`
  as a bare literal. That value is in `INSECURE_SECRET_KEY_DEFAULTS`, so
  anyone who read this repository held the key the service verified with, and
  no `.env` value could displace it.

### D10. The first live verification graded a cached image

The probe stack came up from `ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-core-api:latest`, which
was already on the machine, so the first three posture results described the
pre-fix API rather than this branch. They looked plausible: production refused
and development admitted, which is true of both trees. The tell was the third
case, where a published bind address failed to refuse — a control that does
not exist in the old code. Rebuild before probing, and prefer a probe that has
a case the old code cannot pass.

### D8. Two documents publish the claim-matrix row count in prose

`ROADMAP.md` and `apps/docs/docs/compliance/evidence-pack.md` both state the
figure, and `scripts/check_readme_figures.py` compares them against the live
table. So every PR that adds a claim row moves three files, not one. The gate
caught it on the first attempt here, which is what it is for.

## Notes for the next session

The batch order is dependency-driven, not severity-driven. S1c had to land
before S1 because closing the anonymous path turns 61 console calls into 401s,
and the console had to be able to authenticate first.

S1 split into S1a/S1b (the code that decides whether to admit an
uncredentialed caller, across all eleven services at once so the vendored
copies and their cross-references move together) and S1d (the deployment
paths). They are separable because S1a/S1b close the hole and S1d makes the
documented experience match; shipping the first without the second leaves a
correct default and a stale guide, which is the safe order.

Two things found while fixing S1b that neither brief raised:

* the API's push proxy stamped `X-AiSOC-Internal-Token` while realtime's
  `requireInternal` reads `x-internal-token`, so the token it sent was never
  checked by anything;
* `userOf` in `services/realtime/src/push.ts` preferred a caller-supplied body
  field over the stamped `X-User-Id`, under a comment asserting that the API
  gateway validates it. It does not.

### What this batch actually taught

Not a category of bug. A shape: **a control that exists, passes its tests,
and never runs.** 275 route dependencies read a hardcoded map while the
console wrote to a database nothing consulted. A prompt-injection flag was
read from a field no code ever set. Thirteen Kafka clients each took the
library default. An `ImportError` branch nobody could avoid was the only
reachable path through the SAML assertion consumer.

Three mistakes of my own are worth more than the fixes:

* **A real database caught what a static gate could not.** The obvious
  MSSP policies are mutually recursive; Postgres answers `infinite
  recursion detected` on the first `SELECT` while
  `check_rls_policy_shape.py` passed throughout. Shape is not liveness.
* **Adding one keyword broke four writer signatures and no test failed on
  the exception**, because the call sits inside `contextlib.suppress`.
  What surfaced was a zero write-count in an unrelated replay test three
  files away.
* **The first design for database-backed permissions was wrong.**
  Resolving inside the permission check would have made a transient
  database fault deny every request on the platform. It resolves at
  authentication and fails *open* to the static map, deliberately.

### Still open

`e2e.yml :: Buyer journey` is **intermittently red and not a required
check**. `next/font/google` fetches from Google at compile time, so the
real dependency is the network. Removing the pnpm store cache produced one
green run and the next commit failed again on a different font, so that
hypothesis is disproved and recorded as such in the workflow. The fix is
`NEXT_FONT_GOOGLE_MOCKED_RESPONSES` or self-hosting the five faces through
`next/font/local`.
