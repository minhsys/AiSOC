# Playbooks

Playbooks are reusable, declarative workflows that orchestrate investigation and
response. They run inside the `services/agents` service via the
[`PlaybookEngine`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/tree/main/services/agents/app/playbook/engine.py),
emit realtime events, and can be authored as JSON or via the visual React Flow
editor in the web app.

## Anatomy of a playbook

A playbook is a Pydantic model with metadata, a trigger, and an ordered list of
steps. The wire format is JSON; the runtime model is in
[`services/agents/app/playbook/models.py`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/tree/main/services/agents/app/playbook/models.py).

```json
{
  "id": "ransomware-response-v1",
  "name": "Ransomware Response",
  "description": "Immediate containment and investigation for ransomware detections.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "tags": ["ransomware", "malware", "critical"],
  "trigger": {
    "on": "alert",
    "severity": ["critical"],
    "tags": ["ransomware"]
  },
  "author": "AiSOC",
  "enabled": true,
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "isolate",
      "name": "Isolate affected host",
      "type": "isolate_host",
      "params": { "host_field": "alert.host" },
      "on_failure": "abort",
      "timeout_seconds": 30
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | Stable identifier. Generated if omitted. |
| `name` | string | Human-readable name shown in the UI. |
| `version` | semver | Bumped on every breaking change to the playbook. |
| `tags` | string[] | Free-form labels for filtering and marketplace search. |
| `trigger` | object | When the playbook fires. See [Trigger types](#trigger-types). |
| `steps` | object[] | Ordered list of steps. See [Steps](#steps). |
| `enabled` | bool | Disabled playbooks are skipped by the dispatcher. |

## Trigger types

A trigger declares when the playbook should run. The dispatcher evaluates
triggers against incoming alerts, cases, and schedules.

```json
{
  "trigger": {
    "on": "alert",
    "severity": ["high", "critical"],
    "tags": ["ransomware"],
    "rule_ids": ["AIS-EDR-0001"]
  }
}
```

| `on` | Fires when | Common filters |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `alert` | A new alert arrives in the fusion service | `severity`, `tags`, `rule_ids`, `source` |
| `case` | A case is opened or transitions state | `severity`, `case_status` |
| `manual` | An operator clicks **Run playbook** in the UI | n/a |
| `schedule` | A cron expression matches | `cron` (e.g. `"0 */6 * * *"`) |
| `webhook` | An external system POSTs to `/v1/playbooks/{id}/trigger` | optional `secret` |

Severity values follow the four-tier ladder used everywhere in AiSOC:
`info | low | medium | high`. Vendor-native ladders (Azure, SCC, GitHub) are
collapsed into this set in each connector's `normalize()`.

## Steps

Each step has a `type`. The authoring contract is
[`schemas/playbook.schema.json`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/tree/main/schemas/playbook.schema.json),
and its `x-aisoc-execution` map records what
[`engine.py`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/tree/main/services/agents/app/playbook/engine.py)
actually does with each one. `scripts/check_playbook_schema_parity.py` holds
the two together in both directions, so the table below cannot quietly stop
being true.

**Executed** — a handler runs and has a real effect:

| `type` | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| `enrich` | Calls the enrichment service for IOC reputation, geo, ASN, GreyNoise, VT, OTX. |
| `investigate` | Triggers the AI investigator agent with focus areas (`forensics`, `lateral_movement`, etc.). |
| `notify` | Sends a webhook notification. SSRF-guarded. |
| `http` | Generic outbound HTTP request — `method`, `url`, `body`, `headers`. SSRF-guarded. |
| `close_case` | Marks the AiSOC case as closed via the API service. |
| `condition` | Pure branching node. Evaluates `condition` and routes to `next_true` / `next_false`. |
| `osquery_live_query` | Distributed osquery via osctrl / FleetDM / aisoc-direct, against an allow-listed template. |

**Governed** — the step is dispatched to the action registry in the actions
service, which grades it against the verb's own capability contract and the
tenant's autonomy policy before anything reaches a vendor:

`block_ip`, `block_ioc`, `isolate_host`, `kill_process`, `quarantine_file`,
`run_av_scan`, `run_script`, `disable_user`, `reset_password`,
`revoke_session`, `force_mfa`, `search_siem`, `create_notable_event`,
`create_ticket`.

Each step is dispatched **individually**. Approving or running a playbook does
not authorise whatever its steps happen to contain: the contract is applied
per verb, per step, at the moment that step runs. See
[Live actions](./live-actions.md) for what each verb declares about its impact,
reversibility, approval requirement and verification probe.

What comes back is a report whose `executed` field is the single thing that
means a vendor was actually touched:

| `status` | `executed` | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `executed` | `true` | The vendor ran it. `verification` says whether a probe confirmed the effect, or `unverified` if no probe exists. |
| `awaiting_completion` | `true` | The vendor accepted it and the outcome is not known yet. |
| `dry_run` | `false` | Previewed. This is the default posture — see below. |
| `pending_approval` | `false` | Held for an analyst by the contract or the tenant's tier. Nothing ran. |
| `blocked` | `false` | Refused by tenant policy. |
| `simulated` | `false` | The executor found no usable credentials and took its safe path. |
| `no_integration` | `false` | The verb is supported and this tenant has no enabled connector that performs it. |
| `unsupported` | `false` | No executor is registered for this verb in this deployment. |
| `failed` | `false` | The vendor or the dispatch itself failed. |

A step that did not execute is recorded `FAILED`, so the run halts under the
default `on_failure: abort`. This is deliberate: the steps after a containment
assume the containment happened.

**Execution is off by default.** `AISOC_PLAYBOOK_ACTIONS_EXECUTE` is unset, so
response steps preview and report `dry_run`. Set it to `1` to let a playbook
touch a vendor — and note that governance can still refuse an execution this
allows, and can never allow one it refuses. `AISOC_AGENTS_SERVICE_TOKEN` must
also be set, or the agents service cannot reach the API's service path and the
step fails closed saying so.

**No handler** — `approval` is the one step type the engine accepts and cannot
run. It fails closed with a reason; see
[Approvals and dry-runs](#approvals-and-dry-runs) below.

Common step fields:

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | auto | Used as the target for `next_true` / `next_false`. |
| `name` | required | Human-readable label. |
| `params` | `{}` | Step-specific parameters. Supports `{{field}}` substitution from run context. |
| `condition` | `null` | Optional gate. If false, step is `SKIPPED`. |
| `on_failure` | `abort` | One of `abort`, `continue`, `retry`. |
| `retry_max` | `0` | Retry attempts before applying `on_failure`. Backoff is `min(2^attempt, 30)` seconds. |
| `timeout_seconds` | `30` | Per-step timeout. |
| `next_true` / `next_false` | `null` | Step IDs to jump to for branching. |

## Conditions

A `StepCondition` is evaluated against the run context (which starts as the
trigger payload and accumulates each step's result):

```json
{
  "condition": {
    "field": "alert.severity",
    "operator": "eq",
    "value": "critical"
  }
}
```

Supported operators: `eq`, `ne`, `gt`, `lt`, `contains`, `exists`. The `field`
uses dot-path resolution (`alert.host.name`) and `null` is returned for missing
keys, so `exists` is the safe way to check optional data before branching on it.

## Error handling

The engine treats steps as discrete units of work with structured error
handling.

- `on_failure: "abort"` (default) — failed step stops the run, marks it
  `FAILED`, and emits `run.done` with the error.
- `on_failure: "continue"` — log the failure but proceed to the next step.
  Useful for best-effort enrichment that shouldn't block containment. It
  decides whether the run keeps going, not what the run is called: a run that
  finishes with any failed step is `FAILED`, with an error naming how many and
  which. A green tick over a containment that never happened is the same fake
  success one level up.
- `on_failure: "retry"` — combined with `retry_max`, retries with exponential
  backoff before falling back to whatever you set as the next-failure mode.
- Cycle detection — if the engine revisits the same `step.id`, it aborts with
  `error: "cycle at step <id>"` rather than looping forever.
- Step type with no handler — the step is recorded as `FAILED` with
  `unimplemented: true` and an error naming the verb, so a step the engine
  cannot run never reports success. It is not retried: a handler that is
  missing now will still be missing on the next attempt.

  This page previously said such a step was recorded as `SKIPPED` "so unknown
  actions never silently succeed". The engine did put `skipped: true` in the
  result, but left the step's *status* at `SUCCESS` and the run completed —
  so the documented safety property was the opposite of the behaviour. It now
  does what this section always claimed.

Each step result includes `_elapsed_ms` so you can see per-step latency in the
UI and in run history.

## Approvals and dry-runs

**`dry_run` flag** — pass `dry_run: true` when calling
`PlaybookEngine.run(...)`. Handlers short-circuit with
`{"dry_run": true, "executed": false, "step": <name>}` and emit the same
realtime events, so you can preview an entire run without touching
production. A governed step additionally reports `would_dispatch` and the
`target` it resolved, so a preview of a containment playbook reads as one. A
step whose type has no handler is reported as
`unimplemented: true, would_fail: true`, so a preview tells you which steps a
real run would stop on.

**An `approval` step is not implemented, and is no longer the mechanism.**
The engine is a single pass with no pause or resume, so there is nothing to
suspend and nothing to wake. It fails closed with a reason rather than
pretending, which halts the run under the default `on_failure: abort`.

You usually do not need one. Every response step is graded against its own
capability contract at dispatch and comes back `pending_approval` on its own
when a human is required — `isolate_host`, for instance, declares
`approval: analyst`, which no autonomy tier or confidence level lifts. An
`approval` step in front of it would gate a decision that is already gated.

Where you want an action to actually wait for a named approver, submit it to
the actions service (`POST /actions`), which holds it at `awaiting_approval`
and records the deciding principal. That path is real and audited.

This section previously described a second supported pattern: model the gate
as a `condition` step backed by a field an operator sets via
`POST /v1/playbook-runs/{id}/approve`, and "the engine pauses on the condition
until the field flips, then resumes". No such endpoint exists, and the engine
has no pause or resume — the loop evaluates each condition once against the
run context and moves on. Worse, until recently an `approval` step reported
`SUCCESS` without doing anything, so a playbook that modelled a gate ran
straight through it into whatever it was gating.

## Realtime events

Every run emits events to the realtime service so the UI can stream progress:

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `run.started` | The engine begins executing. |
| `step.started` | Before each non-condition step. |
| `step.done` | After each step, with `status` and `result_keys`. |
| `run.done` | Final state, including the full `PlaybookRun` object. |

Channel format: `playbook:<run_id>`. Subscribe via WebSocket
(`/realtime/ws?channel=playbook:<run_id>`) or the SDK
(`AiSOC.subscribe("playbook", run_id)`).

## Starter templates

AiSOC ships with starter playbooks under
[`services/agents/data/playbooks/`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/tree/main/services/agents/data/playbooks):

## Playbook editor

The visual editor lives at **Playbooks → Editor** in the web app. It is built
on React Flow and lets you:

- Drag-and-drop nodes (trigger, enrichment, decision, action, notification).
- Connect nodes to define `next_true` / `next_false` flow.
- Configure `params`, `condition`, and `on_failure` inline per node.
- Export to JSON, save to the API, or **Run now** with a sample payload.
- Replay a past run with the same trigger context for debugging.
