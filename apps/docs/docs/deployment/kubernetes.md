# Kubernetes Deployment

The supported way to run AiSOC on Kubernetes is the Helm chart shipped at [`infra/helm/aisoc/`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/tree/main/infra/helm/aisoc) in the repo. It deploys every service (api, agents, realtime, mcp, ingest, enrichment, web) plus optional bundled Postgres, Redis, NATS, and OpenSearch via subcharts.

## Helm chart (in-repo)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git
cd AiSOC

# The chart depends on the Bitnami postgresql and redis charts. A clean
# machine has no repository definitions, so `helm dependency update` fails
# with "no repository definition for https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami"
# before it starts. This line was missing, which meant the documented
# Kubernetes path failed at its first command.
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo update

helm dependency update infra/helm/aisoc

helm install aisoc infra/helm/aisoc \
  --namespace aisoc --create-namespace \
  --set secrets.openai.apiKey=sk-... \
  --set postgresql.auth.password=changeme
```

The image tags come from the chart's `appVersion`, so there is nothing to
override for a working install. To pin a different release, note that every
service lives under `services.<name>` — `--set api.image.tag=...` addresses a
path no template reads and silently changes nothing:

```bash
  --set services.api.image.tag=v12.0.0 \
  --set services.web.image.tag=v12.0.0
```

Override any of the defaults in [`infra/helm/aisoc/values.yaml`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/infra/helm/aisoc/values.yaml). For production deployments, walk through the [Hardening Runbook](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/docs/runbooks/HARDENING.md) before exposing the platform on the public internet.

## Container images

All images are published to GHCR and Cosign-signed:

```
ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-core-api:v12.0.0
ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-agents:v12.0.0
ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-realtime:v12.0.0
ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-ingest:v12.0.0
ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-enrichment:v12.0.0
ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-web:v12.0.0
```

The tags above are an example pinned to a release. The current one is whatever
the chart's `appVersion` says, and a default install needs no tag at all.

The chart itself is published to an OCI registry from v11.3.0 onward:

```bash
helm show chart oci://ghcr.io/beenuar/charts/aisoc
```

This page previously named `oci://ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc`, where no chart has
ever been pushed: the command answered `not found`. A published command is a
claim like any other, so `release.yml` now packages, lints and pushes the
chart on every tag, and re-checks that its `appVersion` names images that
exist. Until the first release carrying that job, install from a checkout as
shown below.

### The chart's version, and one coordinate that meant two things

`Chart.yaml` carries two versions. `appVersion` is the application, and is
what every unpinned `tag:` in `values.yaml` falls back to. `version` is the
chart's own, and it is what `--version` selects.

**If you pinned `--version 5.9.2`, pull it again and check what you have.**
v12.3.2 published chart 5.9.2 with `appVersion: v12.3.2`; v13.0.0 bumped
`appVersion` and left the chart version alone, and `helm push` overwrote the
existing version rather than refusing it. `charts/aisoc:5.9.2` therefore names
`v13.0.0` today and named `v12.3.2` before 29 September 2026. The replaced
bytes are gone and cannot be restored — the coordinate is honest from 6.0.0
onward, and 5.9.2 stays ambiguous forever.

`scripts/check_chart_version.py` is what stops the next one. It refuses a
release whose `appVersion` moved while the chart version did not, refuses a
chart edit with no version bump, and asks GHCR whether the version about to be
pushed already exists holding different content — comparing the unpacked
files, because `helm package` output is not byte-reproducible. What it does
not decide is whether a bump is a major, a minor or a patch: nothing in a diff
knows whether a renamed `values.yaml` key breaks your values file, so that
judgement stays with a human.

`scripts/check_published_images.py` resolves every one of these against GHCR
daily, so a name or tag that stops existing fails a build rather than a
`helm install`. It asks whether the tag exists and whether the image behind it
holds the version its tag names — not whether the page names the newest
release, which is why this list can lag one and still pass. This list read `v5.2.0` until v11.1.0 — a tag no image has
ever carried — and two of the names, `aisoc-api` and `aisoc-mcp`, have never
been published at all. The API image is `aisoc-core-api`; the MCP server ships
inside it rather than as its own image.

Verify a signature before deploying:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity-regexp '^https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  ghcr.io/beenuar/aisoc-core-api:v12.0.0
```

## Scaling

The chart deploys `api`, `ingest`, `enrichment`, `alert-fusion`, `agents`,
`web` and `realtime`; `ueba`, `honeytokens` and `purpleTeam` are off by
default. There is no `mcp` deployment — the MCP server runs inside the API.

```bash
kubectl scale deployment aisoc-agents --replicas=3 -n aisoc
kubectl scale deployment aisoc-api --replicas=2 -n aisoc
```

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler manifests are included in the chart — enable them
with `--set services.api.autoscaling.enabled=true` (and similarly for
`agents`, `realtime`). As above, the `services.` prefix is load-bearing.

## Ingress

The chart ships an Ingress template. Configure your hostnames via values:

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: nginx
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  hosts:
    - host: aisoc.example.com         # web (Next.js, port 3000)
      paths: [ "/" ]
    - host: api.aisoc.example.com     # api (FastAPI, port 8000)
      paths: [ "/api", "/healthz" ]
    - host: ws.aisoc.example.com      # realtime (WebSocket + push, port 8002)
      paths: [ "/ws" ]
    - host: mcp.aisoc.example.com     # MCP server (port 8003) — optional
      paths: [ "/mcp" ]
  tls:
    - secretName: aisoc-tls
      hosts:
        - aisoc.example.com
        - api.aisoc.example.com
        - ws.aisoc.example.com
        - mcp.aisoc.example.com
```

## Network policies

The chart includes opinionated `NetworkPolicy` resources that restrict each service to only the dependencies it needs (for example, `agents` can reach Postgres, NATS, and OpenSearch but not the public internet). Enable them with `--set networkPolicies.enabled=true`. They are off by default to keep first-time installs frictionless, and on for any environment that holds real telemetry.
