title: LLM gateway (LiteLLM)
description: Route every live LLM call through a single LiteLLM gateway — assign local or hosted models per task by alias, and get centralized latency/token/cost/error metrics — without changing AiSOC code.

# LLM gateway (LiteLLM)

AiSOC runs several distinct LLM workloads — triage, recon, investigation, the
contextual copilot, summaries, reports, and natural-language generation. The
**LiteLLM gateway** is the single entry point for every *live* LLM call these
workloads make. AiSOC asks for a **logical task alias**; the gateway decides
which real provider and model that alias resolves to.

```
AiSOC task ──▶ alias (e.g. "aisoc-triage") ──▶ LiteLLM ──▶ real model
```

This gives operators two things without any AiSOC code change:

1. **Per-task model assignment.** Point `aisoc-triage` at a cheap local model
   and `aisoc-investigation` at a strong hosted one — or swap either at any time
   — by editing one config file.
2. **Centralized observability.** LiteLLM exports per-task latency, tokens,
   cost, errors, retries, and fallbacks on `/metrics`, scraped by the bundled
   Prometheus (job `aisoc-litellm`). This complements the
   [Investigation Ledger](../concepts/llmops.md), which records *what the agent
   decided*; the gateway records *what each model call cost and how it behaved*.

The gateway sits in front of the LLM tier of the
[multi-model router](../concepts/model-router.md). When no live model is
reachable, AiSOC still degrades to its **deterministic offline path** — the
gateway is never on the critical path for a baseline triage.

## Task aliases

The shipped aliases mirror AiSOC's workloads. They live in
`infra/litellm/config.yaml`:

| Alias                 | Workload                                   | Shipped default   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `aisoc-triage`        | Auto-triage of fused alerts (high volume)  | `gpt-4o-mini`     |
| `aisoc-recon`         | Recon / enrichment reasoning               | `gpt-4o-mini`     |
| `aisoc-investigation` | Deep multi-step investigation              | `gpt-4o`          |
| `aisoc-copilot`       | Contextual analyst copilot                 | `gpt-4o-mini`     |
| `aisoc-summary`       | Alert / incident summaries                 | `gpt-4o-mini`     |
| `aisoc-report`        | Analyst-facing report write-ups            | `gpt-4o`          |
| `aisoc-nl`            | NL→query / NL→detection translation        | `gpt-4o-mini`     |

The "shipped default" is only the *example* mapping in the config — the whole
point is that you change it. The alias names stay constant.

## Enable the gateway

The `litellm` service is in the **CORE** profile, so `make up` and a plain
`docker compose up -d` already start it and routing to it is already wired.
Supplying a key is the only step:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-real-provider-key>    # the gateway uses this to reach the upstream model
LITELLM_MASTER_KEY=<a-strong-key>          # AiSOC authenticates to the gateway with this
```

```bash
docker compose up -d        # or: make up
```

It was a `full`-profile service until 2026-09, which meant a CORE deployment
could not do AI triage *even with a key* — every `aisoc-<role>` alias resolves
here and nowhere else. See
[ADR-0006](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/docs/decisions/0006-llm-gateway-in-core.md)
for the trade-off, including the measured cost of the container.

**With no provider key**, the gateway still boots, serves its seven aliases
and answers `/health/liveliness`; AiSOC makes no LLM call and every alert is
triaged by the deterministic path. Nothing about the install is broken and
nothing claims AI is running.

That is the whole configuration. `docker-compose.yml` sets `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` on
the `api` and `agents` services, and both services' resolvers read it for any
`aisoc-<role>` alias — an alias resolves nowhere else, so the gateway is the
only correct destination for one. The bearer token is resolved with the route:
when AiSOC picks the gateway itself it sends `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY`, never a
provider key, which the gateway would reject as an invalid proxy token.

To send AiSOC somewhere else — a gateway on another host, or your own
OpenAI-compatible endpoint — set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (or `LLM_BASE_URL`) and it
outranks `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` for every role.

### Calling a provider directly, with no gateway

Pin each role to a concrete provider model. A concrete pin is **not** rerouted
to the gateway, so this keeps working with `LLM_GATEWAY_URL` set:

```bash
AISOC_MODEL_PIN_TRIAGE=gpt-4o-mini
AISOC_MODEL_PIN_INVESTIGATION=gpt-4o
# … one per role: triage, recon, investigation, copilot, summary, report, nl
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini                   # the BYOK / "explain this alert" path, direct too
```

With neither the gateway nor pin overrides configured, AiSOC uses its
deterministic offline path, which reports zero model calls and zero tokens
rather than presenting a heuristic as triage.

### A model the gateway does not define is an error, not a fallback

Two failures used to be indistinguishable from "no LLM available", because both
arrived as an exception a caller turned into a deterministic result:

- An `aisoc-<role>` alias sent to a provider default, which does not know the
  name. AiSOC now raises `UnroutableModelError` naming the alias and the remedy
  instead of building a client destined to fail.
- A concrete model sent to the gateway, which answers `Invalid model name`.
  `preflight_llm()` reports this at boot, in both directions, and
  `scripts/check_llm_model_routing.py` fails the build when a model named in
  `.env.example` or `docker-compose.yml` is not one `infra/litellm/config.yaml`
  defines — or when the gateway defines an alias no role requests.

`OPENAI_MODEL` applies to the BYOK / "explain this alert" path **only**. It is
never a task role's model: the auto-triage worker layers a tenant's BYOK
configuration over the role pin, and only the fields the *tenant* set are
treated as overrides, so an environment default cannot displace an alias.

### Embeddings

The MITRE RAG path calls an embedding endpoint, and `infra/litellm/config.yaml`
declares chat aliases only — so embeddings deliberately do **not** follow chat
traffic to the gateway. They have their own pair of variables,
`AISOC_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` and `AISOC_EMBEDDING_MODEL` (default
`text-embedding-3-large`), and default to the provider. The routing gate checks
that exclusion in both directions.

## Re-point a task to a local model

Duplicate the alias in `infra/litellm/config.yaml` with a local backend. The
alias name **must stay the same** so AiSOC is unaware of the swap:

```yaml
- model_name: aisoc-triage
  litellm_params:
    model: ollama/llama3.1
    api_base: http://ollama:11434
```

Commented Ollama, vLLM, and Anthropic examples ship in the config. For a fully
offline deployment, see [air-gapped operation](./air-gapped.md), which fronts a
local Ollama.

## Observe

- **Metrics:** `curl http://localhost:4000/metrics` (or the Grafana/Prometheus
  stack under the `monitoring` profile) shows `litellm_*` counters broken down
  by task alias and model.
- **Health:** `curl http://localhost:4000/health/liveliness`.

## Notes

- Host port `4000` is bound to `127.0.0.1` only, like the rest of the stack.
- No provider key is ever written to `infra/litellm/config.yaml` — aliases
  resolve credentials from the process environment (`os.environ/...`).
