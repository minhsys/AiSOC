# Upgrades and versioning

AiSOC follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) on a single shared version across the monorepo. The authoritative version lives in [`VERSION`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/VERSION); every release tag, container image, and SDK package is stamped with the same number.

This page is what you read before running `git pull` against a new release.

## Release cadence

| Channel | Frequency | What's in it |
|---|---|---|
| **Patch** (`x.y.Z`) | As needed, often weekly | Bug fixes, security patches, doc fixes. Always backwards compatible. |
| **Minor** (`x.Y.0`) | ~Every 1–3 weeks | New connectors, new agents, new endpoints. Backwards compatible — your existing config keeps working. |
| **Major** (`X.0.0`) | When breaking changes accumulate | Schema migrations that require downtime, removed endpoints, renamed env vars. |

Every release ships with a [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) entry that lists added features, behaviour changes, and any breaking notes. **Read it before upgrading across a major version.**

## What "breaking" means in AiSOC

A change is breaking — and therefore lives in a major release — if any of these apply:

1. An existing REST/GraphQL/WebSocket endpoint changes its request or response shape in a non-additive way.
2. An environment variable is renamed or its parsing semantics change.
3. A database migration cannot be rolled back without data loss.
4. A connector schema changes such that previously valid `auth_config` JSON would be rejected.
5. A built-in role's permission list is **reduced** (additions are not breaking).
6. An SDK function signature changes in a non-additive way.

Adding new endpoints, new fields, new connectors, new permissions, or new optional env vars is **not** breaking and ships in minor releases.

## Deprecation policy

When we plan to remove or change something:

1. **Announce in a minor release.** The CHANGELOG calls out the deprecation, the runtime emits a warning log, and the OpenAPI spec marks the endpoint as `deprecated: true`.
2. **Keep working for at least one full major-version cycle.** If we deprecate a behaviour in 6.3.0 and the next major is 7.0.0, the behaviour still works in every 6.x release.
3. **Remove in a major release.** The CHANGELOG's "Breaking" section names the removal explicitly and links to the replacement.

If you depend on something marked deprecated, open an issue — sometimes we extend the window.

## Before you upgrade

Run through this list every time:

1. **Read the CHANGELOG** between your current version and the target. Pay attention to anything labelled "Breaking", "Migration", or "Action required".
2. **Back up your database.** `pg_dump` of the AiSOC schema is the minimum bar. For Kafka- and ClickHouse-backed deployments, snapshot those too.
3. **Snapshot your `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`.** If you lose it during the upgrade, every encrypted connector credential in the database becomes unrecoverable. Treat the key the same way you treat your database backup.
4. **Confirm a maintenance window** for the API service. Migrations run inside a single transaction where possible; minor releases typically take seconds, major releases can take minutes on large `audit_log` tables.
5. **Stage first.** If you operate a non-production tenant on the same code as production, upgrade it first and let it run for a day before promoting.

## In-place upgrade procedure

The supported upgrade path is "stop, pull, migrate, start". Rolling upgrades across multiple API replicas are safe within a minor release; cross-major rolling upgrades are not supported because the running code may not understand the migrated schema.

```bash
# 1. Park new traffic at the ingress (return 503 to the API service).
# 2. Stop the API service replicas. Connectors and ingest can keep running —
#    they tolerate a temporary API outage and back-pressure into Kafka.

cd /opt/aisoc                 # your install path
git fetch --tags
git checkout v7.3.1           # the target tag

# 3. Pull dependencies.
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
(cd services/api && uv sync)

# 4. Run database migrations.
#    From v7.3.1 onwards you can use the CLI directly:
aisoc db upgrade
#    (Equivalent to: cd services/api && uv run python -m app.scripts.run_migrations)
#    Set AISOC_MIGRATIONS_STRICT=1 so a failed migration aborts. Without it the
#    runner logs the failure, rolls that statement back, continues, and exits 0 —
#    which ships a partially-applied schema silently.

# 5. Start the API service back up.
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d api

# 6. Verify health and remove the maintenance gate.
curl -fsS http://localhost:8000/healthz
```

:::tip v7.3.1 migration idempotency
The v7.3.1 release made the close-to-7.x migrations (`005_compliance.sql`,
`025_connectors_click_and_connect.sql`, and the new
`042_alerts_schema_drift_fix.sql`) idempotent. If a previous upgrade left
your `alerts` table partially migrated, just re-run `aisoc db upgrade` —
the migration only adds columns that are missing instead of failing on
already-present ones. See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#731)
for the full column list.
:::

For Kubernetes deployments, the same flow applies: scale the API deployment to zero, run the migration as a `Job`, then scale back up. The Helm chart in [`infra/helm/`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/tree/main/infra/helm) exposes this as `helm upgrade --set runMigrations=true`.

## Verifying the upgrade

After a successful upgrade you should be able to:

- Hit `/healthz` and `/readyz` and get `200 OK` with no `degraded` services in the body.
- Run `aisoc-cli benchmark` (or `pnpm aisoc:benchmark`) and see the same or better numbers as before.
- Open the analyst console and see the version footer match the new tag.
- Check `/api/v1/system/version` and see the same number.

If any of those fail, see [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting). Note what rollback does and does not mean here: `services/api` uses a **forward-only** SQL migration runner (`services/api/app/scripts/run_migrations.py`), not Alembic — there is no `alembic.ini`, no `alembic/` directory, and no downgrade concept. The only services with Alembic are `ueba`, `honeytokens`, `purple-team` and `osquery-tls`. Reverting the **code** to the previous tag is supported; reverting the **schema** is not, so a rollback that needs the old schema means restoring the snapshot taken in step 2 of the pre-upgrade checklist.

## Rolling back

Patch and minor releases are designed to roll back cleanly. The procedure mirrors the upgrade:

```bash
git checkout v7.3.0           # the previous tag
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
(cd services/api && uv sync)
# No schema downgrade step: the API migration runner is forward-only.
# Additive migrations (the common case) are backward compatible, so the previous
# code runs against the newer schema. If a migration was destructive, restore the
# snapshot instead — the CHANGELOG flags those as irreversible.
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f infra/compose/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d api
```

Major releases occasionally ship one-way migrations (e.g. column drops). When that's the case, the CHANGELOG flags the migration as "irreversible" and the only rollback is restoring from the database snapshot you took in step 2 of the pre-upgrade checklist.

## Upgrading across a major

Every major below changes behaviour rather than only schema, so read the row
for each one you are crossing. The authoritative list of what breaks is the
`### BREAKING` section of [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md);
this table says what an operator has to **do**.

| From, to | What changes | What you do |
|---|---|---|
| any, **v10.0.0** | Services stop connecting to Postgres as a superuser, so the 92 row-level security policies begin to apply. The four services running their own alembic chain migrate as the owner, not as the app role. | Run the migrations with `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` set to the owning role. A service that still connects as a superuser bypasses every policy, so check the role before and after. |
| v10, **v11.0.0** | `POST /v1/ingest` and `/v1/ingest/batch` require a credential. CORE needs **8 GB of memory and 20 GB of disk**, up from about 6.5 GB. | Mint an ingest token and set it on every producer before upgrading, or ingestion stops. Check the host has the headroom first. |
| v11, **v12.0.0** | The actions service returns 503 on every mutating route, and the realtime edge rejects every connection, until their required secrets are set. | Set them before you start the stack. Both failures are deliberate and loud. |
| v12, **v13.0.0** | 75 state-changing routes require a permission they did not require before, and several move to `settings:write`, which `soc_analyst`, `soc_lead` and `threat_hunter` do not hold. | Expect HTTP 403 where operators previously got 200. Review who needs `settings:write` before upgrading, not after. |
| v13, **v14.0.0** | No route will confer a role, scope or organisation membership beyond the caller's own authority, and `platform_admin` and `admin` are unreachable from every API route. | The only way to mint a wildcard role is `python -m app.scripts.bootstrap_admin` against the database. Any automation that created one through the API stops working. |
| v14, **v15.0.0** | `/api/v1/shifts` is removed and `/api/v1/threatintel/stix/*` reads answer 404 outside demo mode. `make up` starts a production-class stack and `AISOC_DEV_MODE` no longer defaults to on. | Delete any caller of those routes; neither served data anyone entered. Set `ENVIRONMENT=development` explicitly if you were relying on the dev auth bypass, and expect previously silent warnings to become boot refusals. |
| v15.0.0, **v15.1.0** | Nothing breaks — two routes are added and none removed. Two behaviours change noticeably all the same: **CloudTrail deployments will see more alerts**, because every event previously collapsed onto a single one; and alert-triggered playbooks now actually run, where `find_matching()` had no production caller before. | No action required to upgrade. Expect the CloudTrail alert volume you should have been getting all along, and review which playbooks are enabled before upgrading, since a playbook that never fired will now fire — in preview by default, with three opt-ins needed before it can act. |
| v15.1.0, **v16.0.0** | **The `cases` table is gone.** Migration 083 moves its rows into `aisoc_cases`, repoints the child foreign keys, and renames the old table to `cases_pre_consolidation` so nothing is lost. The two tables never synchronised: the console wrote one and every case metric read the other, so MTTR and the case counts were blind to every case an analyst created. Separately, SAML and OIDC sign-in now works — it returned 403 on every deployment because the connection table had no writer. | **Check your own SQL.** Anything querying `cases` — a Grafana panel, a scheduled export, a report — must read `aisoc_cases`. It will fail loudly with "relation does not exist" rather than returning stale rows, which is deliberate. The archive table is readable if you need to compare. Expect case metrics to change the moment you upgrade: they were under-reporting, not over-reporting. If you use SSO, create a connection at `POST /api/v1/sso-connections` before pointing users at it. |
| v16.0.0, **v16.0.1** | **Nothing breaks.** A security release closing a high-severity privilege escalation (GHSA-4gx4-x7gm-4xq8): the check deciding whether a caller may *confer* authority read the caller's static role, while the check admitting it to the route read its database-resolved permissions. Where a tenant uses the `roles` and `user_roles` tables to narrow an account, those are different answers, and the narrowed account could grant itself anything its unnarrowed role carried. | **Upgrade if you restrict accounts through database-backed RBAC.** A deployment with no RBAC rows was never exposed — the static map was already the correct answer for it. After upgrading, a grant is refused when it exceeds what the caller actually holds, so an operator who had been relying on the wider static role to assign roles will now get HTTP 403; grant that operator the permissions through RBAC rather than widening its static role. |
| v16.0.1, **v17.0.0** | **Three routes are removed**: `POST /detection-loop/suggest` and the two `GET /detection-loop/suggestions` reads, with their three schemas. No migration is needed because none of them ever worked — they queried `aisoc_alerts`, `aisoc_detection_rules` and `alerts.evidence`, none of which any migration creates, so every caller was already receiving an error. The governed equivalent is `POST /api/v1/detection-proposals`. **One number changes meaning without erroring, which is the one to read twice:** `alerts.total` on `/api/v1/metrics/dashboard` now counts *open* work — `new`, `triaging`, `in_progress` — rather than every alert ever received, and the severity counts beside it are scoped the same way. A panel charting cumulative intake from that field will drop to the size of your queue. Closed work is reported separately as `alerts.resolved`. Migration `090` adds three nullable columns to `aisoc_cases`; it is additive and runs automatically. |

Upgrading more than one major at a time is supported but untested as a single
step. Do them one at a time, running migrations between each, so that a
failure names the version that caused it.

## Version skew

Within a given major version, the following components are guaranteed to be wire-compatible across one minor version of skew:

- Browser ↔ API service
- API service ↔ Connectors
- API service ↔ Agents
- SDK clients (Go, Python, TypeScript) ↔ API

That means you can upgrade the API service to `6.1.0` while connectors are still on `6.0.x`, finish their rollout over the day, and not break anything. Across a major version (`6.x` ↔ `7.x`) the contract resets — upgrade the API first, then everything else, on the same maintenance window.

## Long-Term Support

AiSOC does not currently offer formal LTS releases. The most recent major version is the supported version; security patches and CVE fixes are backported to the previous major for **90 days** after a new major lands, which is the window we expect operators to need to plan and execute their upgrade.

If your environment requires a longer support window, raise it in [Discussions](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/discussions) — we're happy to discuss commercial support arrangements with the community.

## Pre-1.0 history

Versions `1.0.0` through `5.x` shipped during the original feature build-out and are documented in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). The `6.0.0` release in May 2026 was the first version we consider production-ready; new deployments should start from the latest tagged release (currently `v7.3.1`).
