abstract: |
  A complete operator's guide to AiSOC: installing it on a laptop and on a
  server, connecting real telemetry, reading what the console shows you, and
  driving it from the REST API or an MCP client.

  Every screenshot is a capture of a running deployment — none is a mockup or
  a demo-mode capture. Every failure in the troubleshooting sections is one
  that has actually been hit, with the cause and the fix. Where a number is
  published it was counted from the tree at the date above; where something
  has not been measured, it says so rather than estimating.
---

## Who this is for

You are installing AiSOC, or you have installed it and something is not
behaving. The guide is linear — each section assumes the one before it — but
the troubleshooting tables are written to be read on their own at the moment
something breaks.

Three audiences, and the paths diverge early:

| You are | Start at | Time |
|---|---|---|
| Evaluating on a laptop | *Workstation install* | ~10 minutes |
| Deploying for a team | *Server install* | ~45 minutes |
| Integrating with something | *The REST API* or *MCP* | — |

---

## 1. What you are installing

AiSOC is a security operations platform: it ingests security telemetry,
normalizes it, runs detections, correlates what fires into alerts, and has an
AI agent triage them. It is not a SIEM replacement — it does not do long-term
log retention or compliance search — and it does not discover telemetry you
have not connected.

### The pipeline, end to end

```

### Deployment profiles

| Profile | Services | Memory | Disk | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CORE** (`make up`) | 16 | 8 GB | 20 GB | The whole pipeline, AI triage with a local model, real threat intel. No credentials of any kind |
| **full** (`make up-full`) | 22 | 12 GB | 40 GB | CORE plus ClickHouse, Neo4j, Qdrant, UEBA — hunting, the entity graph, behavioural analytics |

CORE is not a demo. It runs the real pipeline and a real local model; what it
leaves out is the stores that only matter once you have volume.

### Where the model runs

A model ships with AiSOC and runs on CPU, which is why `make up` needs no
account, no key and no GPU. It is also the slowest of four options.

| Option | Command | Works on |
|---|---|---|
| Bundled model, CPU | `make up` | everything |
| Bundled model, NVIDIA GPU | `make up-gpu` | Linux, Windows + WSL2 |
| An Ollama you already run | `make up-host-llm` | everything, and the **only** GPU route on a Mac |
| A hosted provider | configured in the console | everything |

`make doctor` tells you which fits the host you are on. The first-run wizard's
**Choose where the AI runs** step tells you which is in effect right now.

**The GPU reservation is an overlay, not a line in the base compose file**, and
that is deliberate rather than tidy. A host without an NVIDIA GPU *and* the
container toolkit cannot start a service that reserves one — the daemon
answers `could not select device driver "nvidia"` and refuses — so putting it
in `docker-compose.yml` would take out first run for every Mac, every CPU-only
Linux box and every CI runner.

`make up-gpu` runs `scripts/check_gpu_runtime.py` first, which exists because
the daemon's own error names neither a cause nor a next command. The preflight
distinguishes a missing card, driver, toolkit and daemon configuration, and
names the install step for whichever is absent.

**On Apple Silicon, `make up-gpu` cannot help and the preflight says so.**
Docker Desktop does not pass the Metal GPU into a Linux container — no toolkit,
driver or setting changes that, so a container on a Mac is CPU-only whatever is
reserved. A natively-installed Ollama *does* use Metal:

```bash
brew install ollama
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve          # in its own terminal
ollama pull llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M
make up-host-llm
```

`OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` matters: Ollama binds loopback by default, which a
container cannot reach.

`make up-host-llm` is worth running even without a GPU. `11434` is in the
managed port inventory, so on a host already running Ollama, `make up` sees the
conflict and republishes the *bundled* one on a free port — leaving you with
two Ollamas, the stack talking to the new one, and yours idle.

#### Checking what is actually running

A GPU reservation is a **request**. A model can still land on the CPU for want
of VRAM or a usable driver, so reading the compose file back would report the
intent and call it the outcome. Ask instead:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8000/api/v1/llm/runtime -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
docker compose exec ollama ollama ps     # SIZE and the GPU/CPU split
```

Five answers, and **not loaded right now** is one of them: Ollama unloads after
a few minutes idle, so an empty answer means nobody has asked it anything yet.
That is not the same as CPU, and reporting CPU there would be a guess about the
exact thing you are deciding on.

| `placement` | Means |
|---|---|
| `gpu` | the whole model is in VRAM |
| `partial` | split; `detail` says what fraction, which explains the latency |
| `cpu` | entirely on the CPU |
| `unknown` | nothing loaded, so it cannot say |
| `unreachable` | nothing answered — expected on a hosted-provider deployment |

---

## 2. Workstation install

For evaluating, developing, or running a small deployment on a laptop.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Docker | 24+ with Compose v2 | The whole stack is containers |
| Memory allocated to Docker | 8 GB for CORE, 12 GB for full | Below this, services restart-loop |
| Disk free in the Docker VM | 20 GB | Kafka corrupts its log directory when it runs out, and its healthcheck still passes |
| `make`, `git`, `curl` | any | Driving the stack |

On macOS the Docker VM has its own disk allocation, separate from your
machine's. Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources is where you raise it, and
"I have 500 GB free" is not the relevant number.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git
cd AiSOC
make up
```

That is the whole thing. `make up` generates real secrets into `.env`,
creates an administrator, and prints the password once.

**Do not run `cp .env.example .env` first.** It used to be a documented step
and it made things worse: the example file carried an invalid Fernet
placeholder, and the credential vault treats *empty* as "use an ephemeral dev
key" while *non-empty-and-invalid* is fatal. Copying the file gave you HTTP
500 on every connector save, discovered at the connector wizard rather than at
boot. Not copying it gave you a working vault.

### Verify it came up

```bash
make doctor
```

`doctor` queries each datastore rather than asking whether its container is
up, which is the distinction that matters — a Kafka with a corrupt log
directory reports healthy and moves nothing.

```bash
make smoke
```

One real event through the real spine: it mints an ingest token, confirms an
unauthenticated write is refused, then watches the event be accepted, carried
by Kafka, detected and promoted by fusion, and land as an alert in Postgres.
If this passes, the product works on your machine.

### First sign-in

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Sign in with the administrator `make up`
created — the password was printed once during install, and
`make bootstrap ARGS=--reset-password` mints a new one if you lost it.

![The AiSOC dashboard on a fresh CORE install](apps/web/public/screenshots/dashboard.png)

*The operations funnel over real counts on a fresh install. Note `MTTR` reads
**not measured · no cases closed** rather than `0` — an average over zero rows
is not zero, and publishing it as zero would claim instant resolution.*

### Workstation troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `port is already allocated` | Something else holds 5432, 6379, 9092 or 3000 | `make doctor` names the process or container. Postgres on 5432 and Ollama on 11434 are the two most likely, and the installer reassigns rather than refusing |
| Kafka healthy, nothing flows | Docker VM out of disk. Kafka corrupts its log dir and the healthcheck still passes | `docker system prune -af`, then `make clean && make up` |
| `make smoke` fails at "became an alert" | fusion is down or not consuming | `docker compose logs fusion \| tail -60` |
| Console loads but is empty | No data yet. This is correct | `make smoke`, or load sample data from the setup wizard |
| Services restart-loop | Not enough memory for `full` | Use `make up` (CORE) and raise Docker's allocation before retrying |
| `credential vault unavailable` saving a connector | `AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY` is set to something that is not a valid Fernet key | `make env` generates a real one, then `docker compose up -d api` |
| `make doctor` shows 22 red checks | You have not run `make up` yet | Run it. `doctor` says this explicitly rather than listing failures |
| `make doctor` warns that Ollama holds 11434 | You already run Ollama | Not a problem. `make up-host-llm` uses yours instead of starting a second one; `make up` republishes the bundled one on a free port |
| `make up-gpu` refuses before compose starts | The NVIDIA container toolkit is missing, or this is a Mac | The preflight names which of the four pieces is absent. On Apple Silicon no install helps — use `make up-host-llm` |
| Triage is slow | The model is on CPU, which is the default | `GET /api/v1/llm/runtime` confirms it. `make up-gpu`, `make up-host-llm`, or a hosted provider |
| AI verdicts stopped after adding a provider key | The key is wrong, revoked, or names a model the account cannot use | **Settings → Deployment & AI → Test.** It distinguishes a bad key from a wrong model name, which are different fixes |

### Windows

`install.ps1` handles Windows 10 and 11 through `winget`. Run it from an
elevated PowerShell. It creates the administrator and runs the smoke test, the
same as the Unix path — an earlier version handed off to a demo stack and
printed "AiSOC is up and running" without doing either.

---

## 3. Server install

For a deployment a team will use.

### Sizing

| Deployment | vCPU | RAM | Disk | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CORE, evaluation | 4 | 8 GB | 50 GB | Fine for a few connectors |
| full, small team | 8 | 16 GB | 200 GB | ClickHouse grows with retention |
| full, production | 16 | 32 GB | 500 GB+ | Size the lake from your event rate × retention |

Event volume drives the lake more than anything else. A deployment taking
1,000 events/second at 1 KB each writes roughly 86 GB/day before compression.

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git
cd AiSOC
make up-full
```

Then, before anyone else touches it:

```bash
make doctor
make smoke
```

### Make it production-class

`make up` is a development posture. Four changes make it a deployment:

**1. Set the environment.** The default is `development`, and
`AUTH_BYPASS_ENVIRONMENTS` contains `development`, which means a request with
no credentials is served as an administrator.

```bash
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

This is not theoretical. The default shipped that way, and because
`bootstrap_admin`'s tenant was byte-identical to the demo tenant, an
anonymous caller landed in the *real* administrator's tenant rather than a
sandbox. Both defaults now read `production`, and the two tenant ids are
asserted different at runtime — but a deployment that overrides it back is
back in that state.

**2. Put TLS in front of it.** AiSOC serves plain HTTP and expects a reverse
proxy to terminate TLS. Nothing in the stack does it for you.

**3. Keep the secrets `make up` generated.** They are in `.env`, they are
real, and they are per-deployment. Back the file up somewhere that is not the
server.

**4. Set the CORS origin** to your console's real address. The default is
permissive enough for localhost and wrong for anything else.

```bash
AISOC_CORS_ORIGINS=https://soc.yourcompany.example
```

The shared CORS module **refuses to start** when `AISOC_CORS_ORIGINS`
contains `*` while credentials are enabled and `AISOC_ENV=production`, which
is the one misconfiguration here that cannot be made quietly.

### Server troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Console loads, every API call 401s | `ENVIRONMENT=production` with no administrator created | `make bootstrap ARGS=--reset-password` |
| Connectors save but never poll | The scheduler registered every job paused | Fixed in current releases. Check `last_sync` on the connector: a null that never changes is this |
| Alerts arrive with source `unknown` | The connector has no ingest profile, so it fell through to the lenient fallback | Check `connectorProfiles` in `services/ingest/internal/normalizer/normalizer.go` |
| Events ingest but no alerts appear | The fallback classifies events as OCSF category 4, and promotion needs category 2 or `severity_id >= 4` | Same cause as above. A vendor finding that already passed the vendor's correlation belongs at `class_uid: 2001` |
| `/api/docs` returns 404 | `make up` starts a production-class stack with the spec disabled | This is intended. Use `docs/openapi.yaml` in the repository |
| Everything is slow under load | One connection acquire per alert write | Current releases batch; check you are not pinned to an older image |

### Upgrading

```bash
git pull
make up          # migrations run automatically
```

Migrations are idempotent and verified across three consecutive full passes in
CI. Before a major upgrade, take a backup and **verify it**:

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh --component all
./scripts/restore.sh --timestamp <ts> --component all --dry-run
```

The dry run fetches, verifies and decrypts every artefact without writing. A
backup you have never restored is a hypothesis.

---

## 4. Connecting real data

Two ways in: push to the ingest API, or configure a connector that pulls.

### Push

```bash
export AISOC_INGEST_TOKEN=$(make ingest-token)

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/ingest/batch \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AISOC_INGEST_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "connector_id": "edr-1",
    "connector_type": "crowdstrike",
    "events": [{
      "severity": "high",
      "title": "Encoded PowerShell from Office",
      "host": "WIN-FIN-01",
      "user": "a.hassan@example.com"
    }]
  }'
```

The tenant comes from the token, not from a header. It used to come from a
caller-supplied `X-Tenant-ID` that was never checked against the tenants
table, on an endpoint with no authentication at all.

### Pull

![The connector catalogue](apps/web/public/screenshots/connector-wizard.png)

*The connector wizard, reporting **84 connector types available** — generated
from the registry, not hand-typed.*

Settings → Connectors → Add connector. Credentials are encrypted at rest with
Fernet before they touch the database.

![The connector surface with nothing connected](apps/web/public/screenshots/connectors.png)

*An honest empty state. Nothing is invented to fill the page.*

Connecting a source is meant to be the only manual step: the scheduler polls
on a five-minute default, events flow to ingest, fusion promotes what matters,
and the agent triages every fused alert. No further intervention.

### Bringing existing detections

`packages/aisoc-migrate` translates Splunk SPL, Sentinel KQL and Elastic EQL:

```bash
python3 packages/aisoc-migrate/inbound.py --dialect spl --file my-searches.txt
```

It **refuses rather than approximating** what it cannot carry — `transaction`,
`lookup`, `join`, `sequence` and six others. An almost-right detection is
harder to find than a missing one: it sits in the catalogue, fires on the
wrong thing, and nobody checks it against the original.

Measured on the 2,005 quarantined Splunk rules bundled in this repository:
1,734 translate, and **1,711 of those are partial** — field matches carried,
thresholds did not, because the corpus is aggregation-heavy. Read 86.5% as "a
useful head start", not "a finished migration".

---

## 5. Using it

### The alert queue

![The alert queue](apps/web/public/screenshots/alerts-queue.png)

*Twelve alerts the pipeline produced from pushed telemetry, each attributed to
the connector that fed it.*

Alerts are ordered by a priority score: severity multiplied by asset
criticality, identity privilege and known-exploited-vulnerability exposure.
Context multiplies and never sums, so it reorders alerts of similar severity —
which is what it is for — and cannot push an informational alert above a
critical one.

Every factor that moved the score is recorded with its contribution. An
ordering you cannot interrogate is one you stop trusting the first time it
surprises you.

### The investigation rail

![The investigation rail](apps/web/public/screenshots/investigation-rail.png)

*The rail's Story view. Note the progression line: "no ATT&CK tactic is
mapped … that is a gap in the detection's metadata rather than a statement
about the activity." The product distinguishes what it does not know from what
is not there.*

### AI triage

![A real local-model triage verdict](apps/web/public/screenshots/ai-triage-verdict.png)

*A verdict from the bundled local `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M`: true
positive, confidence 80/100, groundedness **not assessed**, and the model's
own rationale verbatim. No hosted provider was configured.*

What the agent does and does not do:

- **It reads** the alert, its correlated siblings, entity context, and prior
  verdicts for the same signature.
- **It calls typed tools** — lake queries, graph traversals, enrichment
  lookups. The model picks the tool and passes arguments; it never writes SQL.
- **Everything is logged** to the Investigation Ledger: prompts, tool calls,
  citations, verdict, token cost. It exports as a signed bundle.
- **Grounding is checked on both paths.** A verdict citing an indicator the
  evidence never contained is demoted to human review rather than auto-closed.
  On the investigation path — the one you launch deliberately — nothing
  auto-closes, so the intervention is different: the reported confidence drops
  to the measured groundedness and a caveat naming the unsupported indicators
  is written into the summary you read.
- **No vendor is touched without a human**, unless a tenant has explicitly
  granted autonomy for that verb.

The gate **refuses to score an empty evidence set**, and reports
`groundedness: null` rather than `0.0`. The distinction is the whole point: a
case opened by hand carries no telemetry, every indicator the model mentions
would read as unsupported, and a gate that scored anyway would demote
everything while appearing to catch hallucination. `null` means not measured;
`0.0` means measured and nothing was supported.

### Using your own provider

Seven providers are supported — `openai`, `anthropic`, `azure-openai`,
`local-ollama`, `local-vllm`, `local-litellm`, `custom`. Configure one per
tenant in **Settings → Deployment & AI**, or from the first-run wizard. The key
is encrypted at rest with the credential vault and never returned by the API;
reads report only `has_api_key`.

**Test it before you rely on it.** The *Test* button places one real one-token
completion and reports what happened:

```bash
curl -sX POST localhost:8000/api/v1/llm/credentials/test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

| Outcome | Means |
|---|---|
| `ok` | the provider answered. A `429` counts — being rate-limited means you reached it and were authenticated |
| `refused` | reached it and it said no. `detail` distinguishes a bad key from a wrong model name, which are different fixes |
| `unreachable` | nothing answered at that address |
| `unverified` | air-gapped, so the call was **not attempted** — the policy working, not a bad key |

Before this existed, the credential routes validated only *shape* — that the
URL parses, that the provider/key/base-URL combination is consistent — and none
of them talked to the provider. A revoked key surfaced as triage quietly
falling back to the deterministic path, which is a failure that is hard to
attribute to a credential precisely because it is silent.

### Threat intelligence

![The CISA KEV catalogue](apps/web/public/screenshots/threat-intel-kev.png)

*1,725 real Known Exploited Vulnerabilities entries, fetched from the public
CISA catalogue. Not synthetic, not ours, unmodified — and the page
distinguishes the catalogue size from the page it is showing.*

### Hunting

![The hunt workbench](apps/web/public/screenshots/hunt.png)

*Natural language becomes a templated ES|QL, SPL or KQL query. The agent never
writes raw query text.*

Hunting needs the `full` profile, because it reads the ClickHouse lake.

### The entity graph

![The entity graph](apps/web/public/screenshots/attack-graph.png)

*The graph over real ingested telemetry, with Neo4j running.*

![The same page in CORE](apps/web/public/screenshots/attack-graph-core-degraded.png)

*The same page in CORE, where Neo4j is not running. It names the failure —
`API 503 … /api/v1/graph` — instead of drawing an invented graph. This is as
much of the product as the populated view.*

### Playbooks

![The playbook library](apps/web/public/screenshots/playbooks.png)

![The step palette](apps/web/public/screenshots/playbook-editor.png)

*Twenty-one tiles from a twenty-two-member vocabulary. `approval` is withheld
where the engine has no durable pause — a step that cannot suspend should not
be offered.*

### The case lifecycle

Six states, and the machine is forward-only:

```
new → triaged → investigating → contained → resolved → closed
                      │
                      └──────────────────► resolved
```

Two readings catch people out. **`resolved` is not terminal** — it means the
case has an outcome, not that it has been closed out; only `closed` writes
`closed_at`, which every duration metric reads. And **`open` is not a state**:
it belonged to a pre-consolidation vocabulary and the database rejects it, so
a filter naming it returns nothing rather than erroring, which is why it took
a while to notice.

Forward-only is deliberate. It is what makes "this case was closed" mean
something, and without it a title edit that happens to carry a status could
walk a case backwards silently. So reopening is its own act, with its own
record:

```bash
curl -sX POST "localhost:8000/api/v1/cases/$CASE_ID/reopen" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"reason": "The indicator reappeared on two more hosts overnight."}'
```

It requires a reason, increments `reopen_count`, and clears `closed_at` and
`resolved_at` so a case cannot be counted as terminal and active at once.
`reopen_count` exists because `reopened_at` is overwritten each time — a case
reopened four times is a different conversation from one reopened once.

### Honest empty states

![No cases](apps/web/public/screenshots/cases-empty.png)

![Federated search with no SIEM connected](apps/web/public/screenshots/federated-search.png)

*Both say plainly that there is nothing, and the second names the four SIEMs
it would query. Production never falls back to synthetic data: an unreachable
backend makes the console name the failure rather than invent an
investigation.*

---

## 6. The REST API

**518 operations across 417 paths.** The specification is
`docs/openapi.yaml` in the repository, regenerated on every change and gated
against breaking changes in CI.

### Authenticating

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"admin@aisoc.internal","password":"'"$PASSWORD"'"}' \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["access_token"])')
```

### The endpoints you will use first

| Purpose | Call |
|---|---|
| List alerts | `GET /api/v1/alerts` |
| One alert with its investigation envelope | `GET /api/v1/alerts/{id}` |
| Create a case | `POST /api/v1/cases` |
| Launch an investigation | `POST /api/v1/cases/{id}/investigate` |
| Poll an investigation | `GET /api/v1/cases/{id}/investigations/{run_id}` |
| Query the lake | `POST /api/v1/lake/sql` |
| Propose a detection | `POST /api/v1/detection-proposals` |
| Configure SSO | `POST /api/v1/sso-connections` |
| Reopen a closed case | `POST /api/v1/cases/{id}/reopen` |
| Where the local model is running | `GET /api/v1/llm/runtime` |
| Test the tenant's provider credential | `POST /api/v1/llm/credentials/test` |
| Dashboard tiles for a window | `GET /api/v1/metrics/dashboard?period=7d` |

Two contract details that cost people time:

- `GET /api/v1/alerts` returns the array under **`items`**, not `alerts`.
- On `/metrics/dashboard`, **`alerts.total` is open work, not everything ever
  received.** It counts `new`, `triaging` and `in_progress`, and the severity
  counts beside it are scoped the same way, because the console labels them
  *Active Alerts* and *Critical — Require immediate action*. Closed work is
  reported separately as `alerts.resolved`. Period-over-period `deltas` on
  `/metrics/funnel` are **percentages** — `5.0` means +5%, and a client that
  multiplies by 100 again renders `-93.75` as `-9375%`.

### Groups worth knowing about

| Tag | Operations | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| `mssp` | 33 | Child tenants, portfolio views, cross-tenant overrides |
| `detection_rules` | 30 | The rule catalogue, tuning, proposals, backtesting |
| `cases` | 25 | Cases, tasks, comments, evidence, investigations, reopen |
| `scim` | 21 | SCIM 2.0 user and group provisioning |
| `graph` | 14 | Entity graph traversal, blast radius, context import |
| `connectors` | 13 | Catalogue, instances, test-connection, scheduling |
| `llm` | 6 | Provider configuration, where the model runs, credential testing |

### Rate limits and errors

Errors carry a `detail` that names the cause. A refusal says what was refused
and why — a 403 on an attribute condition tells you which condition, because
a bare 403 is indistinguishable from a missing role and people debug the wrong
thing for an hour.

---

## 7. MCP

AiSOC ships an MCP server, so an MCP-capable client can read alerts, cases and
the decision ledger directly.

### Connecting

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aisoc": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "app.server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/AiSOC/services/mcp",
      "env": {
        "AISOC_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
        "AISOC_API_TOKEN": "your-token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### The tools

Thirty-one, in four groups:

| Group | Tools | For |
|---|---|---|
| **Triage** | `aisoc_list_alerts`, `aisoc_get_alert`, `aisoc_get_triage_verdict` | Reading the queue and what the agent concluded |
| **Investigation** | `aisoc_list_cases`, `aisoc_get_case`, `aisoc_run_investigation`, `aisoc_list_investigations` | Driving and following an investigation |
| **Audit** | `aisoc_replay_decision`, `aisoc_explain_step`, `aisoc_get_replay_report` | The prompt, the response and the tools used, for any step |
| **Content and data** | `aisoc_query_detections`, `aisoc_get_detection_rule`, `aisoc_lake_query`, `aisoc_lake_schema` | The rule catalogue and the event lake |

Every agent decision is written to a persistent ledger, and
`aisoc_replay_decision` and `aisoc_explain_step` are the auditable surface
over it. That is the part worth using: you can ask the system to show you
exactly what it was told and exactly what it said back.

### A typical session

1. `aisoc_list_alerts` → find what is open.
2. `aisoc_get_alert` → read one, with its correlated siblings.
3. `aisoc_run_investigation` → have the agent work it.
4. `aisoc_explain_step` → audit any step it took.

## 8. Security posture

| Control | State |
|---|---|
| Secrets | Generated per deployment, never committed |
| Connector credentials | Fernet-encrypted at rest; key rotation supported |
| Database access | Services connect as a DML-only role, so row-level security applies |
| Tenant isolation | Enforced at the query layer in every store, not by RLS alone |
| Route authorization | RBAC on every mutating route |
| Ingest | Authenticated; the tenant comes from the token |
| Prompts | Validated before they are sent. Raw logs, OCSF payloads and secret-shaped values are refused, not redacted afterwards |
| Outbound LLM | None by default. The bundled model runs beside the stack |

**A service with no credential refuses to serve rather than serving
unauthenticated.** That is the rule the posture rests on.

### Enterprise SSO

SAML and OIDC, with the tenant and group mapping held on the *connection* an
administrator configured rather than read from the assertion. An identity
provider that can name its own tenant can name somebody else's.

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sso-connections
```

If that returns `[]`, every SSO sign-in will 403 — there is no connection to
resolve. Create one disabled, check the mapping, then enable it.

A mapping to `admin` or `platform_admin` is refused: those are reachable only
through `bootstrap_admin`, and a group mapping would be a way back in.

## 9. Backup and disaster recovery

```bash
./scripts/backup.sh --component all
./scripts/restore.sh --timestamp 20260503T120000Z --component all
```

Six stores are covered. Two of them have deliberate behaviour worth knowing:

**Redis asks you to confirm, and the default is not to restore it.** It holds
only state the platform rebuilds, and a restored cache serves stale answers
with full confidence — worse than a cold start.

**Neo4j replays Cypher rather than loading a dump**, because `neo4j-admin
load` needs the database stopped, and the platform degrades gracefully without
the graph. Statements apply one at a time so a single failure does not discard
the restore, and failures are counted and surfaced.

## 10. Honest limits

Stated plainly, because a guide that only lists strengths is a brochure.

- **No hosted LLM provider has been exercised.** Every published agent figure
  comes from a locally served model. The hosted path exists and is untested.
- **Long-duration scale figures do not exist.** The harness has ramp, burst,
  backpressure and 24/72-hour soak profiles; the long ones have not been run,
  and no throughput number is claimed from them.
- **Package distribution is blocked on credentials.** The release workflow
  builds and packs all eight npm and PyPI packages on every tag; the upload
  step is credential-gated. Install from source.
- **Benchmark numbers are labelled.** Three of the four eval metrics are
  substrate self-consistency gates, not agent accuracy. Only MITRE accuracy
  measures the live agent, and the benchmark page says which is which.
- **Response is not autonomous by default.** It requires explicit policy
  authorization and a human approver.

## Credits

Development of AiSOC is **funded and supported by Cyble**
(<https://cyble.com>), who pay for the engineering time behind the project and
release it under the MIT licence rather than keeping it.

That funding buys no special treatment in the product: there are no
Cyble-only features, no gated modules, and no telemetry reporting back to
anyone. The same code, under the same licence, for everybody.
