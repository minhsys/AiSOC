/**
 * AiSOC root (`/`) — marketing landing page.
 *
 * Two sections here were arguments made out of nothing. `DemoEmbed` drew a
 * hand-authored Investigation Ledger — an invented incident id, an invented
 * confidence, an invented dollar spend against a named hosted model — and was
 * the only place the site claimed to show the console. `Testimonials` offered
 * to onboard reference partners through a window that had already closed.
 * They are replaced by `ProductTour`, which is four captures of a running
 * stack, and `HonestLimits`, which is the list of things the product does not
 * do yet. Both are server components; the pair they replace shipped
 * framer-motion, a BorderBeam and a meteor field to animate claims that were
 * not true.
 *
 * Above-the-fold sections
 * (StickyNav, Hero, ProofStrip, Problem) are eagerly imported because
 * they sit inside the LCP window. Everything below the fold is loaded
 * via `next/dynamic` so the initial JS chunk shipped to the browser
 * stays well under the 180 kB gzipped budget in §12 of the brief.
 *
 * SSR is preserved for every section (`ssr: true` is the default of
 * `next/dynamic`); we only code-split the client-side bundle. That
 * keeps the SEO crawl path intact and lets the JSON-LD payload below
 * render the same copy a human visitor sees.
 *
 * The page is dark-locked via a nested `data-theme="dark"` boundary,
 * same pattern the previous root used — every gradient, glow, and
 * tinted overlay in the section components was tuned against the dark
 * palette and migrating each to themable tokens would balloon T6.5 for
 * no buyer-visible win. The console chrome (TopBar / Sidebar / etc.)
 * still honours the toggle, which is what AGENTS.md WS-F1 promised.
