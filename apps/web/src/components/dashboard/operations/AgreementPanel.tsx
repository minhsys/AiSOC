/**
 * How often the agent and this tenant's own analysts reached the same verdict.
 *
 * Gap-closure Phase 2.2.
 *
 * The rest of this dashboard answers "is the pipeline working". This panel
 * answers the question that decides whether any of it gets trusted with a
 * decision: on the alerts your analysts have closed, how often was the agent
 * right, and how often did it catch the ones that mattered.
 *
 * Three rules this panel follows, each because the obvious alternative
 * misleads in the direction that sells.
 *
 * **A rate with no denominator reads "not measured", never 0.** A zero in the
 * agreement column says the agent was wrong every time. "It has not been
 * asked yet" is a different fact calling for a different response, and on a
 * new deployment it is always the true one.
 *
 * **Every rate is printed with the count behind it.** 100% over four answers
 * is not the claim 100% over four hundred is, and a tile showing only the
 * percentage has thrown that distinction away.
 *
 * **The recent slice is shown beside the window, not instead of it.** A
 * thirty-day average is where a gradual decline hides: an agent that agreed
 * 99% of the time for three weeks and 70% this week still posts about 95%.
 * Showing only the window would make this panel the thing that conceals the
 * problem it exists to reveal.
