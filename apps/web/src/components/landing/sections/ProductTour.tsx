/**
 * "What it looks like running" — the screenshot section.
 *
 * This replaces `DemoEmbed`, which rendered a hand-authored mock of the
 * Investigation Ledger: a named ransomware family, a 0.93 confidence, a
 * $0.084 spend against a named hosted model, "4 hosts · 2 users", all of it
 * invented and none of it labelled as such. A marketing surface asserting
 * measurements the product never produced is the exact shape this repository
 * has a standing rule against, and it was the only place on the site that
 * claimed to show the console.
 *
 * Every image below is a capture of a running CORE stack. The manifest beside
 * them (`apps/web/public/screenshots/README.md`) records, per file, what was
 * observed and what was authored, and the captions here are written against
 * it. The distinction that matters, stated once in the section lede and kept
 * out of no caption: the *security events* were written by hand and pushed
 * through the documented ingest API — normalization, detection, promotion,
 * correlation and triage were performed by the running services, and no row
 * was seeded. The CISA KEV catalogue is neither ours nor synthetic. Nothing
 * here is a real intrusion and no caption may imply one.
 *
 * Two of the four figures are deliberately empty or degraded. They are the
 * argument, not an omission: a console that reports "API 503" instead of
 * drawing a graph it does not have is the difference being sold.
 *
 * Server component. No `'use client'`, no animation library, no state — the
 * previous section shipped framer-motion and a BorderBeam to animate a
 * fiction. Four `next/image` tags cost the route nothing at runtime.
