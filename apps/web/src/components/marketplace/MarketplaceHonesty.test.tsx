/**
 * A catalogue entry that cannot fire must not read like one that can.
 *
 * 4,388 of the 7,155 entries in `marketplace/index.json` — 61% — are rules
 * the detection engine does not load. The only thing distinguishing them from
 * executable content was the *absence* of a green "Verified" badge. They were
 * sorted together, described identically, and offered the same Install
 * button, which for a rule the engine never loads flips a per-tenant flag and
 * enables nothing.
 *
 * This project's standing rule is that quarantined or aspirational content is
 * never presented as executable. These assertions are that rule, applied to
 * what a reader of the catalogue actually sees.
 *
 * Both directions. A view that had simply removed the Install button, or
 * badged everything "reference only", would pass a one-sided suite and be
 * just as wrong in the other direction.
