/**
 * Autonomy posture scorecard (Phase C3).
 *
 * Sits atop the per-action guardrail editor (`AutonomyPolicy.tsx`) and answers
 * the question a CISO actually asks: "how autonomous is my SOC right now, and
 * where does a human still sign off?" It computes an honest posture from the
 * *configured* per-action policy (not fabricated runtime stats):
 *
 *   - **Posture** — Copilot (the safe default: high/critical-blast actions
 *     always require a human) vs Autopilot (at least one high-blast action is
 *     configured to auto-execute). Data-class scoping is expressed through the
 *     per-action blast radius, so the scorecard groups by blast radius.
 *   - **Distribution** — how many actions auto-execute, queue for review, or
 *     always gate on a human, bucketed by blast radius.
 *
 * The compute is a pure function so it's unit-tested directly; the component is
 * a thin presentational shell.
 *
 * Gap-closure Phase 2.2 added the second half. The posture above describes
 * what the tenant has *configured*; `TrackRecord` describes what the agent has
 * *earned*, measured against the same analysts' own closures. Both belong on
 * one card because the question they answer together is the only one worth
 * asking: is this posture justified. A configured posture on its own says
 * nothing about whether the agent deserves it, and the numbers on their own
 * say nothing about whether anyone has acted on them.
 *
 * The track record is optional. A deployment that has never run shadow mode
 * has no measurement, and the card says that rather than rendering zeroes,
 * which would read as an agent that agrees with nobody.
