# Architecture

Every box in every diagram below corresponds to code in this repository, and
links to it. Where a component exists but is not used, it says so rather than
being quietly drawn in.

## What happens when AiSOC receives one security event

Follow a single event. This is the whole system, in order.

**1. Something sends telemetry.** Either a connector polls a vendor API on a
schedule, or a tool pushes to the ingest HTTP API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/ingest/batch \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Tenant-ID: <your-tenant>' \
  -d '{"connector_id":"edr-1","connector_type":"crowdstrike","source_format":"json",
       "events":[{"severity":"high","title":"Encoded PowerShell from Office",
                  "host":"WIN-FIN-01","process_name":"powershell.exe",
                  "parent_process":"winword.exe"}]}'
```

**2. Ingest normalizes it.** [`services/ingest`](../../services/ingest) maps
the vendor payload onto a common OCSF-shaped envelope using a per-connector
profile. A connector with no profile falls through to a vendor-neutral generic
profile, which resolves `actor.user.name`, `device.name` and `src_endpoint.ip`
from the spellings connectors actually use (`user` / `username` / `actor`,
`host` / `hostname`, `src_ip` / `source_ip` / `client_ip`) in a fixed order.
The event keeps the entities the rest of the platform pivots on; what a vendor
profile adds is that vendor's own field names and its OCSF class.

`connector_type` is matched against the profile keys, and the identifiers the
connectors service declares are the ones to use — `crowdstrike`, not
`crowdstrike_falcon`. Both resolve, and
[`scripts/check_connector_profiles.py`](../../scripts/check_connector_profiles.py)
fails CI if any name in either direction stops resolving.

**3. It enters the event spine.** Ingest publishes to the Kafka topic
`aisoc.raw_events`. This is the boundary that makes everything downstream
independent: anything can consume the spine without ingest knowing about it.

**4. Fusion consumes it and evaluates detections.**
[`services/fusion`](../../services/fusion) runs the 2,603 executable rules
against the event — 833 native and 1,770 imported Sigma rules, each of which
was replayed through its real connector and this engine and watched to fire
before it was allowed into the compiled ruleset. Separately it decides whether the event is *promotable* —
a vendor finding (OCSF category 2) or anything at severity ≥ high becomes an
alert; routine telemetry does not.

Each match is then checked against that tenant's **tuning overlay**
([`tenant_overlay.py`](../../services/fusion/app/services/tenant_overlay.py)):
the disables, severity floors and suppressions the console writes to
`detection_rules`. Before this existed the engine evaluated the shared corpus
and nothing else, so a tenant who turned a noisy rule off kept receiving its
alerts while the console showed it disabled — the worst shape a defect can
have, because it tells the operator the problem is solved.

It is an overlay rather than a per-tenant ruleset: the *difference* applied
over one shared corpus, not N copies of 2,603 rules rebuilt whenever anyone
edits anything. Suppression is applied **after** the match so the dropped hit
is logged with the tuning, its author and its reason — "no alert" with no
explanation is indistinguishable from a rule that simply did not match. A
reload that fails keeps the previous overlay rather than falling back to
no-tuning, since losing a tenant's suppressions on a transient database error
would turn their queue back on and read as a flood rather than a fault.

**5. Fusion correlates.** A new alert is matched against open incidents using
a correlation key of `{tenant}:{entity}:{tactic}`. It either joins an
existing incident or opens a new one, so ten related alerts become one thing
an analyst looks at.

**6. The alert is written to Postgres** and published to
`aisoc.alerts.fused`.

**7. Two consumers pick it up.**
[`services/realtime`](../../services/realtime) pushes it to the console over
WebSocket. [`services/agents`](../../services/agents) auto-triages it with an
LLM — a verdict, a confidence, and proposed actions.

**8. The agent's work is written to the Investigation Ledger** — every
prompt, tool call and citation, so a verdict can be audited rather than
trusted.

**9. A playbook may start from the alert.** The fused-alert path matches it
against the playbook library
([`alert_trigger.py`](../../services/agents/app/playbook/alert_trigger.py)),
*after* triage, because a playbook's conditions read the verdict and the
confidence. Three switches must all agree before one acts — the deployment,
the tenant, and the playbook — and **every default is off**. Anything short of
all three runs in **preview**, with its plan and simulated steps attached to
the alert so an analyst can read what it would have done. Preview is the
default state rather than a mode somebody has to remember to use first.

**10. An approval step is a durable pause.** A playbook that reaches one
suspends to Postgres (migration `081`) rather than failing: the step index and
the whole run context, so the run survives a restart and resumes from the step
*after* the approval when a human decides. Undecided approvals expire with a
recorded outcome, because `expired` is a decision and a pause with no deadline
is a run that hangs forever while nobody learns it did.

**11. Response stays governed.** An action is proposed; a human with the right
permission approves it; the result is verified against the vendor rather than
assumed from an HTTP 200.

> **Where it stops, stated precisely.** A *playbook* can now be triggered
> automatically — that changed, and the three switches above are what bound
> it. What did not change is the thing that matters: every response step is
> still graded against its own capability contract at dispatch and returns
> `pending_approval` on its own when a human is required. So approving a
> playbook never authorises whatever its steps happen to contain, and there
> is still no code path that touches a vendor without either a human or an
> explicit per-tenant autonomy policy. That is the honest boundary of
> "autonomous" in this project.

        os["OpenSearch<br/><br/>full-text IOC and actor search"]
    end
```

**Why each one, and what breaks without it:**

| Store | Why it is not replaceable by Postgres | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | — | Nothing works. |
| **Redis** | Correlation needs expiring keys at event rate; TTL semantics and throughput are the point. | No correlation; every alert becomes its own incident. |
| **Kafka** | Decouples producers from consumers and lets a slow consumer fall behind without dropping events or blocking ingest. | No spine; fusion, realtime and agents would each need a direct call from ingest. |
| **ClickHouse** | Columnar scans over hundreds of millions of events. Postgres cannot do this at cost. | No event lake, no hunting over raw telemetry. **Alerting is unaffected.** |
| **Neo4j** | Multi-hop traversal ("what else did this identity touch") is a join explosion in SQL. | No graph context or blast radius. `/graph` reports the failure rather than drawing an invented graph. Alerting unaffected. |
| **Qdrant** | Vector similarity for IOC and actor matching, and the read path the console's Threat Intelligence page is served from. | No threat-intel page. It is in CORE for that reason, and because it is by a wide margin the cheapest of the four stores — 245 MB of image, ~79 MiB resident. |
| **OpenSearch** | Full-text and structured search over the threat-intel corpus — `threatintel-iocs` and `threatintel-actors`. | Feeds still write to Qdrant and the page still works; full-text IOC search is unavailable and `services/threatintel` logs that it is. |

**Who reads OpenSearch, precisely:** only `services/threatintel`. This page
previously said nothing read it at all, which came from checking
`services/api` — which genuinely holds no OpenSearch client — and stopping
there. It also said `services/threatintel` *could not start* without it; that
was true when the lifespan called `os_store.initialize()` with no `try`, and
is no longer — both that call and the pipeline's bulk index are best-effort,
which is what let the service move into CORE. See the corrections in
[the reality audit](../audit/REPOSITORY_REALITY.md).

## Diagram 4 — AI investigation

```mermaid

    participant A as services/agents
    participant C as LLM input contract
    participant M as Model
    participant L as Investigation Ledger
    participant H as Analyst

    K->>A: fused alert
    A->>A: gather evidence (alert, entities, prior verdicts)
    A->>C: proposed prompt
    C-->>A: refuse if it contains raw logs or secrets
    C->>M: validated prompt
    M-->>A: verdict + confidence + cited indicators
    A->>A: groundedness check
    Note over A: an indicator the evidence<br/>never contained demotes<br/>the verdict to human review
    A->>L: prompt, tool calls, citations, verdict
    A->>H: proposed actions (never executed)
    H->>H: approve, with permission + separation of duties
```

Three properties worth naming, because each is enforced in code:

- **The contract runs before the request.** A prompt about to carry raw OCSF,
  vendor log lines or secret-shaped values is refused, not logged after the
  fact.
- **Citations are checked against the evidence.** A verdict citing an
  indicator that was never in the evidence is demoted rather than auto-closed.
- **Approval is authorized, not just recorded.** The approver must hold the
  action's permission tier and must not be the requester.

## Deployment profiles

One architecture, three profiles of it — not three architectures.

| Profile | Command | Services | RAM | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **core** | `make up` | 16 | ~8 GB | Ingest → detect → correlate → alert → triage → console, plus the LLM gateway, the local model behind it, the CISA KEV threat feed with its vector store, and the connector and response services the agent's vendor tools reach. |
| **full** | `make up-full` | 22 | ~12 GB | Core plus event lake, entity graph, full-text search, enrichment, scheduled connectors. |
| **demo** | `make up && make demo` | 16 | ~8 GB | Core plus clearly-labelled synthetic data. |

`full` is 22 services, not the 30 published here previously: 30 is `full` plus
the `monitoring`, `chatops`, `extras` and `osquery` profiles, which
`make up-full` does not start. The CORE count is **16 long-running
containers**; `ollama-pull` is a seventeenth that runs once and exits, and is
excluded because "long-running services" is the figure these documents
publish.

This page said 14 for as long as `connectors` and `actions` had been in CORE,
because it was the one place publishing a service count that
[`scripts/check_profile_service_counts.py`](../../scripts/check_profile_service_counts.py)
did not know about. It is registered now, so the next change to the compose
file fails the build here too rather than only in the eight places that were
already covered.

CORE is not a toy. It is the smallest deployment that can take a real event
and produce a real alert, which is the thing the product is for — **and it does
that, and triages the result with a real model, with no credentials**. Three
services moved into CORE to make that last clause true:

* **`litellm`** — the gateway. Every `aisoc-<role>` alias resolves here and
  nowhere else, so a CORE deployment *with* a provider key could not use it.
* **`ollama` (+ a one-shot `ollama-pull`)** — the model behind the gateway,
  pinned at `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` (~2 GB, CPU-only). Promoted from the
  air-gapped overlay, where this pairing was already proven end to end. Without
  it the gateway in CORE could route a key nobody had.
* **`threatintel` + `qdrant`** — the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities feed,
  which is public and keyless, and the store it writes to. OpenSearch and Neo4j
  stay in `full`: both sinks are best-effort, so their absence costs full-text
  IOC search and the actor graph, not the feed.

**Two flags travel with the `full` profile.** The lake writer and the
graph writer target stores that exist only there, so in CORE they default off
rather than retrying against a host that is not running:

```bash
AISOC_LAKE_WRITER_ENABLED=true AISOC_GRAPH_ENABLED=true \
  docker compose --profile full up -d
```

`make up-full` sets both for you, and the integration workflow sets the same
pair — so the documented command and the tested command are the same command.

---

## What a first run does differently

Nothing above changes on a fresh install — that is the point of this section.
The paths a new deployment takes are the same paths, arranged so an operator
can reach them.

**The host decides the ports, not the compose file.** `make up` probes the
sixteen host ports CORE publishes and moves any that are taken, writing
`docker-compose.ports.yml` with `ports: !override` and naming what held each
one. Only the published side moves: service-to-service traffic uses container
ports and service names, so nothing in any diagram above is affected. If the
console itself moves, `AISOC_CONSOLE_URL` moves with it so the address printed
at the end is the one that answers.

This replaced a refusal. `make up` used to stop and tell the operator to edit
`docker-compose.yml`, which is a hard stop at step one of the quick start for
the most common condition in this audience's environment — a Postgres on 5432,
or an Ollama on 11434.

**The console asks the database what is set up, not a flag.**
`GET /api/v1/onboarding/status` derives first-run state from the tenant's own
rows. A stored `onboarded` boolean drifts the moment somebody connects a source
through the API, deletes their last one, or restores a backup, and a wizard
insisting you are finished while your estate is empty is worse than no wizard.
A tenant with no connectors and no alerts lands on the setup checklist rather
than on an all-zero dashboard.

**Sample data takes the real path.** `POST /api/v1/onboarding/sample-data`
pushes five scenarios through `POST /v1/ingest/batch` — step 1 above, the same
door a connector uses — so they are normalised, correlated and triaged exactly
like real telemetry. Inserting rows would have been easier and would have
proved nothing: a console full of seeded alerts looks identical whether the
pipeline works or is completely broken. Because these take the real path,
seeing them arrive means the operator has watched steps 1 through 8 work.

Three constraints keep that honest, and each is asserted by test rather than
left to care:

* **It does not clear `first_run`.** Somebody who has only looked at samples
  still has nothing connected.
* **It refuses on a tenant that already has real alerts.** A sample sitting in
  a live queue is indistinguishable from a real one at a glance, and an analyst
  dismissing a genuine alert because they assumed otherwise is the worse
  outcome.
* **It is obviously synthetic.** Every address is an RFC 5737 documentation
  range and every domain RFC 2606 reserved, and `aisoc_sample` has its own
  ingest profile naming AiSOC as the vendor — so the alert's own source column
  says where it came from, without anyone needing to remember context.

That profile exists for the same reason every other one does. Without it the
batch would fall to the generic profile, every event would get the same title
and no vendor id, and all five would deduplicate onto one alert.

## Verifying any of this

```bash
make up && make smoke
```

`make smoke` posts one event to the ingest API and follows it through Kafka,
fusion, detection, promotion and Postgres, then reads it back from the public
API. It reaches past nothing. Each stage reports PASS or FAIL separately, so
a break names the boundary that broke.

Source: [`tests/e2e/golden_pipeline/`](../../tests/e2e/golden_pipeline/).

### What CI proves about each piece above

`make smoke` is the whole pipeline. Each capability in it also has a check
that runs on **every pull request with no path filter**, drives the real
production path against real infrastructure, and carries a negative control
— something that breaks the thing and is required to turn the check red.
The bar, and why it is that bar, is in
[`docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md`](../audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md).

| What it proves | Workflow | What breaking it looks like |
|---|---|---|
| Graph reads are tenant-scoped in `graph_service.py` | `graph-live.yml` | Remove the anchor's tenant predicate → 1 test fails |
| UEBA scores and persists against the shipped migrations | `ueba-live.yml` | Drop `peer_group_id` → 4 of 5 fail |
| An approval pause survives a restart and resolves once | `playbook-pause-live.yml` | Drop the partial unique index → the constraint test fails |
| The Investigation Ledger persists, scopes and refuses | `playbook-pause-live.yml` | — |
| Tenant tuning changes what the engine fires | `tenant-tuning-live.yml` | Re-add the two columns the table lacks → 6 of 10 fail |
| SCIM provisions and isolates through the real app | `scim-live.yml` | Remove the tenant predicate → the isolation test fails |
| A connector polls a vendor and reaches ingest | `connector-scheduler-live.yml` | `next_run_time=None` → 4 of 5 fail |
| Governance permits, refuses, and leaks no refusal | `live-actions-live.yml` | Remove all three branches → the refused isolate reaches the vendor |
| The shipped ClickHouse DDL loads; `POST /lake/sql` scopes | `lake-live.yml` | Make the rewrite a pass-through → 6 of 7 fail |
| Scheduled hunts read tenant data, never the fixture | `lake-live.yml` | — |
| Intel travels feed → Kafka → sweep → alert | `retro-hunt-live.yml` | Remove the per-tenant savepoint → 5 of 8 fail |
| The agent places a real LLM call on this commit | `live-agent-eval.yml` | `llm_calls_placed: 0` fails the job |

Two of those rows exist because the suite behind them found a defect no
offline test could: the connector scheduler registered every poll job
**paused**, so connecting a source never pulled data; and the retro-hunt
fan-out flushed one tenant's rows under the *next* tenant's RLS context,
so it persisted nothing on any deployment using the runtime role.
