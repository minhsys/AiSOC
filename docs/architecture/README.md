# Architecture

Every box in every diagram below corresponds to code in this repository, and
links to it. Where a component exists but is not used, it says so rather than
being quietly drawn in.

## What happens when AiSOC receives one security event

Follow a single event. This is the whole system, in order.

**1. Something sends telemetry.** Either a connector polls a vendor API on a
schedule, or a tool pushes to the ingest HTTP API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/v1/ingest/batch \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Tenant-ID: <your-tenant>' \
  -d '{"connector_id":"edr-1","connector_type":"crowdstrike","source_format":"json",
       "events":[{"severity":"high","title":"Encoded PowerShell from Office",
                  "host":"WIN-FIN-01","process_name":"powershell.exe",
                  "parent_process":"winword.exe"}]}'
```

**2. Ingest normalizes it.** [`services/ingest`](../../services/ingest) maps
the vendor payload onto a common OCSF-shaped envelope using a per-connector
profile. A connector with no profile falls through to a vendor-neutral generic
profile, which resolves `actor.user.name`, `device.name` and `src_endpoint.ip`
from the spellings connectors actually use (`user` / `username` / `actor`,
`host` / `hostname`, `src_ip` / `source_ip` / `client_ip`) in a fixed order.
The event keeps the entities the rest of the platform pivots on; what a vendor
profile adds is that vendor's own field names and its OCSF class.

`connector_type` is matched against the profile keys, and the identifiers the
connectors service declares are the ones to use — `crowdstrike`, not
`crowdstrike_falcon`. Both resolve, and
[`scripts/check_connector_profiles.py`](../../scripts/check_connector_profiles.py)
fails CI if any name in either direction stops resolving.

**3. It enters the event spine.** Ingest publishes to the Kafka topic
`aisoc.raw_events`. This is the boundary that makes everything downstream
independent: anything can consume the spine without ingest knowing about it.

**4. Fusion consumes it and evaluates detections.**
[`services/fusion`](../../services/fusion) runs the 2,603 executable rules
against the event — 833 native and 1,770 imported Sigma rules, each of which
was replayed through its real connector and this engine and watched to fire
before it was allowed into the compiled ruleset. Separately it decides whether the event is *promotable* —
a vendor finding (OCSF category 2) or anything at severity ≥ high becomes an
alert; routine telemetry does not.

**5. Fusion correlates.** A new alert is matched against open incidents using
a correlation key of `{tenant}:{entity}:{tactic}`. It either joins an
existing incident or opens a new one, so ten related alerts become one thing
an analyst looks at.

**6. The alert is written to Postgres** and published to
`aisoc.alerts.fused`.

**7. Two consumers pick it up.**
[`services/realtime`](../../services/realtime) pushes it to the console over
WebSocket. [`services/agents`](../../services/agents) auto-triages it with an
LLM — a verdict, a confidence, and proposed actions.

**8. The agent's work is written to the Investigation Ledger** — every
prompt, tool call and citation, so a verdict can be audited rather than
trusted.

**9. Response stays governed.** Nothing executes automatically. An action is
proposed; a human with the right permission approves it; the result is
verified against the vendor rather than assumed from an HTTP 200.

> **Where it stops.** Step 9 has no automatic trigger — there is no code path
> that dispatches a response without a human. That is deliberate, and it is
> the honest boundary of "autonomous" in this project.

## Diagram 3 — who owns which data

    subgraph req ["CORE"]
        pg["PostgreSQL<br/><br/>alerts · incidents · cases<br/>users · tenants · detection rules<br/>audit log · investigation ledger"]
        rds["Redis<br/><br/>correlation windows<br/>dedup keys<br/>investigation run state"]
        kaf["Kafka<br/><br/>aisoc.raw_events<br/>aisoc.alerts.fused<br/>aisoc.alerts.dlq"]

        neo["Neo4j<br/><br/>entity graph<br/>blast radius"]
        os["OpenSearch<br/><br/>full-text IOC and actor search"]
    end
```

**Why each one, and what breaks without it:**

| Store | Why it is not replaceable by Postgres | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL** | — | Nothing works. |
| **Redis** | Correlation needs expiring keys at event rate; TTL semantics and throughput are the point. | No correlation; every alert becomes its own incident. |
| **Kafka** | Decouples producers from consumers and lets a slow consumer fall behind without dropping events or blocking ingest. | No spine; fusion, realtime and agents would each need a direct call from ingest. |
| **ClickHouse** | Columnar scans over hundreds of millions of events. Postgres cannot do this at cost. | No event lake, no hunting over raw telemetry. **Alerting is unaffected.** |
| **Neo4j** | Multi-hop traversal ("what else did this identity touch") is a join explosion in SQL. | No graph context or blast radius. `/graph` reports the failure rather than drawing an invented graph. Alerting unaffected. |
| **Qdrant** | Vector similarity for IOC and actor matching, and the read path the console's Threat Intelligence page is served from. | No threat-intel page. It is in CORE for that reason, and because it is by a wide margin the cheapest of the four stores — 245 MB of image, ~79 MiB resident. |
| **OpenSearch** | Full-text and structured search over the threat-intel corpus — `threatintel-iocs` and `threatintel-actors`. | Feeds still write to Qdrant and the page still works; full-text IOC search is unavailable and `services/threatintel` logs that it is. |

**Who reads OpenSearch, precisely:** only `services/threatintel`. This page
previously said nothing read it at all, which came from checking
`services/api` — which genuinely holds no OpenSearch client — and stopping
there. It also said `services/threatintel` *could not start* without it; that
was true when the lifespan called `os_store.initialize()` with no `try`, and
is no longer — both that call and the pipeline's bulk index are best-effort,
which is what let the service move into CORE. See the corrections in
[the reality audit](../audit/REPOSITORY_REALITY.md).

## Diagram 4 — AI investigation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant K as Kafka aisoc.alerts.fused
    participant A as services/agents
    participant C as LLM input contract
    participant M as Model
    participant L as Investigation Ledger
    participant H as Analyst

    K->>A: fused alert
    A->>A: gather evidence (alert, entities, prior verdicts)
    A->>C: proposed prompt
    C-->>A: refuse if it contains raw logs or secrets
    C->>M: validated prompt
    M-->>A: verdict + confidence + cited indicators
    A->>A: groundedness check
    Note over A: an indicator the evidence<br/>never contained demotes<br/>the verdict to human review
    A->>L: prompt, tool calls, citations, verdict
    A->>H: proposed actions (never executed)
    H->>H: approve, with permission + separation of duties
```

Three properties worth naming, because each is enforced in code:

- **The contract runs before the request.** A prompt about to carry raw OCSF,
  vendor log lines or secret-shaped values is refused, not logged after the
  fact.
- **Citations are checked against the evidence.** A verdict citing an
  indicator that was never in the evidence is demoted rather than auto-closed.
- **Approval is authorized, not just recorded.** The approver must hold the
  action's permission tier and must not be the requester.

## Deployment profiles

One architecture, three profiles of it — not three architectures.

| Profile | Command | Services | RAM | What you get |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **core** | `make up` | 14 | ~8 GB | Ingest → detect → correlate → alert → triage → console, plus the LLM gateway, the local model behind it, and the CISA KEV threat feed with its vector store. |
| **full** | `make up-full` | 22 | ~12 GB | Core plus event lake, entity graph, full-text search, enrichment, scheduled connectors. |
| **demo** | `make up && make demo` | 14 | ~8 GB | Core plus clearly-labelled synthetic data. |

`full` is 22 services, not the 30 published here previously: 30 is `full` plus
the `monitoring`, `chatops`, `extras` and `osquery` profiles, which
`make up-full` does not start. (The CORE count is fourteen long-running
containers; `ollama-pull` is a fifteenth that runs once and exits.)

CORE is not a toy. It is the smallest deployment that can take a real event
and produce a real alert, which is the thing the product is for — **and it does
that, and triages the result with a real model, with no credentials**. Three
services moved into CORE to make that last clause true:

* **`litellm`** — the gateway. Every `aisoc-<role>` alias resolves here and
  nowhere else, so a CORE deployment *with* a provider key could not use it.
* **`ollama` (+ a one-shot `ollama-pull`)** — the model behind the gateway,
  pinned at `llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M` (~2 GB, CPU-only). Promoted from the
  air-gapped overlay, where this pairing was already proven end to end. Without
  it the gateway in CORE could route a key nobody had.
* **`threatintel` + `qdrant`** — the CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities feed,
  which is public and keyless, and the store it writes to. OpenSearch and Neo4j
  stay in `full`: both sinks are best-effort, so their absence costs full-text
  IOC search and the actor graph, not the feed.

**Two flags travel with the `full` profile.** The lake writer and the
graph writer target stores that exist only there, so in CORE they default off
rather than retrying against a host that is not running:

```bash
AISOC_LAKE_WRITER_ENABLED=true AISOC_GRAPH_ENABLED=true \
  docker compose --profile full up -d
```

`make up-full` sets both for you, and the integration workflow sets the same
pair — so the documented command and the tested command are the same command.

---

## Verifying any of this

```bash
make up && make smoke
```

`make smoke` posts one event to the ingest API and follows it through Kafka,
fusion, detection, promotion and Postgres, then reads it back from the public
API. It reaches past nothing. Each stage reports PASS or FAIL separately, so
a break names the boundary that broke.
