"""Benchmark metrics: accuracy, hallucination, containment, cost.

Pillar 4. The existing scoreboard publishes MITRE accuracy and three
substrate self-consistency numbers. Three metrics the plan calls for are
absent, and each is absent for the same reason: they are the ones that make
an agent look worse.

**Hallucination rate.** Measured, not estimated: the fraction of concrete
indicators an agent cites that do not appear anywhere in the evidence it was
given. An agent that invents a plausible IP address to justify a verdict is
doing the single most dangerous thing an analyst-replacement can do, and no
accuracy number reveals it.

**Containment accuracy.** Whether the proposed action matches what the
incident needed. An agent that reaches the right verdict and proposes
isolating the wrong host has not helped.

**Calibration.** Confidence is only useful if it tracks correctness.
Published as the gap between mean confidence on correct answers and on wrong
ones; a small or negative gap means the confidence score carries no
information, and everything downstream that gates on a threshold is gating
on noise.

Abstention is treated as its own outcome throughout rather than folded into
either accuracy or error. "I do not know" is a correct answer that a
forced-choice benchmark punishes, and punishing it trains agents to guess.
The abstention rate is published beside accuracy so the two cannot be traded
off invisibly.

    to be read back out of the sentences.

    The pattern set is :data:`_INDICATOR_PATTERNS`, unchanged, which is what
    makes this an extension of the existing hallucination measurement rather
    than a second one. Anything this returns is by construction something
    :func:`is_checkable_indicator` accepts, so both paths grade the same

    Over-counting is the safe direction and is the one this errs in: a phrase
    shaped like a domain that is really an English abbreviation will be
    checked against the evidence and, if absent, counted as hallucinated. That
    makes the published rate a ceiling rather than a flattering floor, and the
    per-decision list travels with the report so a disputed count can be
