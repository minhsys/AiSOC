"""A benign corpus that actually looks like a SOC queue.

Gap-closure wave 2.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Every labelled corpus in this repository was malicious by construction,
so no verdict accuracy could be measured from any of them — an agent
answering "true positive" to everything scores 100%. The benchmark
corpus appeared to have a benign class and did not: `build_corpus.py`
derived one from ``response_class == "monitor"``, and those eight
incidents are BloodHound domain enumeration tagged **T1087.002** at
medium severity. That is a real attack with a monitoring response, not a
benign event. Labelling it benign conflated "low-severity threat" with
"not a threat", which is the single most important distinction a triage
agent makes.

What makes a benign corpus useful
------------------------------------
**The cases must look like attacks.** A benign corpus of obviously
boring events measures formatting, not judgement: any agent can tell a
successful DNS lookup from ransomware. Every case here is something that
*fires a real detection rule* and is nonetheless the right answer to
close. PsExec at 02:00 during a change window. Encoded PowerShell in a
deployment script. Nmap from the scanner subnet. Bulk file reads by the
backup agent.

**The telemetry must have the same shape.** These carry the same fields,
the same sources and the same severity distribution as the malicious
set, so a model cannot separate the classes on format. Where the
distinguishing evidence exists it is *in the content* — a change ticket
reference, a known service account, a scanner's own subnet — which is
exactly what an analyst reads.

Two classes, and the difference matters
------------------------------------------
``benign`` — the activity happened and was authorised. The detection was
right to fire; the answer is "this was us".

``false_positive`` — the activity did not happen as the alert
characterises it. The rule matched something it should not have.

They are different operationally: a stream of ``benign`` means tuning an
allowlist, a stream of ``false_positive`` means fixing a rule. Collapsing
them, as a single "not malicious" label would, loses the action.

Addresses and names
-------------------
RFC 5737 documentation ranges and RFC 2606 domains throughout, asserted
by test. A corpus that shipped a routable address would eventually have
somebody scan it.

# the ones that genuinely vary between occurrences; **the evidence that
# decides the label is never varied**, because a case whose answer moves
# with its hostname is not the same case.
