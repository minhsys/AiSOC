# aisoc-cli

Developer CLI for building, validating, and publishing AiSOC plugins and detection rules.

> **Status — monorepo today, not yet on PyPI.** The CLI ships from this monorepo and is fully functional today. `pip install aisoc-cli` does not resolve: the upload is blocked on registry credentials, which is an account action rather than a code change. The CLI name (`aisoc`) and command surface stay identical once it ships.

## Installation

```bash
# Today (from this monorepo):
git clone https://github.com/beenuar/AiSOC.git
cd AiSOC && pip install -e packages/aisoc-cli

# Not yet on PyPI — the upload is blocked on registry credentials,
# which is an account action rather than a code change. Until then, install
# from source with the command above.
#   pipx install aisoc-cli     # recommended (isolated venv)
#   pip install aisoc-cli
```

## Commands

### Plugin Scaffold
```bash
aisoc plugin scaffold my-enricher
aisoc plugin scaffold my-connector --type connector
```

### Plugin Validate
```bash
aisoc plugin validate ./my-enricher
aisoc plugin validate ./my-enricher/plugin.yaml
```

### Plugin Publish
```bash
export AISOC_API_URL=https://api.example.com
export AISOC_API_KEY=sk-...
aisoc plugin publish ./my-enricher
```

### Detection Validate
```bash
aisoc detection validate ./detections/brute-force.yaml
```

### Key Generation
```bash
aisoc keygen              # generates ~/.aisoc/signing.key + signing.pub
```
