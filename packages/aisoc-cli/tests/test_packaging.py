"""The built wheel must carry the scaffold templates.

`aisoc plugin new` reads them through `importlib.resources.files("aisoc_cli")`,
so a wheel without them installs cleanly and then fails on first use — the
worst shape of packaging bug, because `pip install` reports success.

This exists because the opposite mistake shipped: `pyproject.toml` declared
`packages = ["src/aisoc_cli"]` *and* a `force-include` mapping the same
templates directory to the same wheel path, so hatchling tried to add each
file twice and refused to build at all:

    ValueError: A second file is being added to the wheel archive at the same
    path: aisoc_cli/templates/connector/README.md.tmpl

Nothing built this wheel except a release tag, so it was invisible until the
release ran, and it would have blocked the first real publish. Removing the
redundant mapping is only safe if something checks the templates still arrive.
