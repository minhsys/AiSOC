Phase 2.6 — audit that every FastAPI service installs the shared
``/livez`` + ``/readyz`` probes from :mod:`app._health`.

Background
----------

Before Phase 2.6 most services exposed only a ``/health`` endpoint
that conflated liveness ("the process is running") and readiness
("the process is wired up to its dependencies and can serve
traffic"). Kubernetes-style orchestrators need both signals
separately so they can keep a slow-starting pod in the cluster
while still draining it cleanly on shutdown.

This script enforces the invariant that every service which
ships a ``main.py`` under ``services/<svc>/app/`` also ships a
copy of ``_health.py`` next to it AND wires the probes into
that ``main.py``. Without this gate a new service can be added
that boots fine but never produces readiness signal — a silent
operational gap that wouldn't surface until a 3am page.

Usage

    # Print the audit table.

    to be identical, so the claim was true by luck: any change landing in one
    tree would have left the other twelve serving the older contract, and a
    probe that answers differently per service is worse than one that is
    wrong everywhere — it makes a fleet-wide readiness answer unreadable.

    never written, so the sync it promised had no implementation either.
