"""Gate: every response action must declare what it does to a production estate,
and every verb the agent recommends must be one this service can perform.

Pillar 3. An action registry is only useful if it can answer, before running,
what an action does when the finding is wrong. Four things were previously
inferred rather than declared, each with its own failure mode:

  risk            inferred from the capability name in one place and a policy
                  table in another, which can disagree
  reversibility   a hardcoded list of four actions; nothing said whether a
                  fifth could be undone
  verification    absent, so an action reported success on an HTTP 200 and
                  nobody knew whether a probe existed to check the effect
  approval        no way to express "no tier may ever auto-execute this", only
                  "the current tier happens not to"

This asserts every registered executor declares a coherent contract, and that
the declarations are internally consistent — a HIGH-impact action with no
verification probe fails here rather than in an incident.
