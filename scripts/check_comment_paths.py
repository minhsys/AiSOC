"""Every repository path named in a code comment must exist.

Why this exists as a separate gate
----------------------------------
``docker-compose.yml`` carried a reference to an ADR under
``docs/architecture/decisions/`` — a path with no directory behind it. Two
workstreams tripped over it within an hour, and it had survived every check
in the tree, because **a comment is the one place no gate reads**.
``check_repo_self_links.py`` opens markdown and matches
``github.com/...`` URLs; lychee resolves links; nothing had ever looked at
the prose inside source files, which is where most cross-file references in
this repository actually live.

That prose is load-bearing. "Keep this in sync with X", "the operator table
lives at Y", "CI check Z compares the two sets" — each is an instruction to
the next contributor, and each is worthless the moment the path is wrong. On
its first run this gate found nine dead references in comments and thirteen
more in Python docstrings, including a migration renumbered 055 → 063, a
connector doc that moved under ``apps/docs/docs/``, and three separate
pointers at CI checks that had never been written.

What it reads, and what it deliberately does not
------------------------------------------------
The corpus was measured before the gate was written, because a naive version
would have been mostly noise. Of **3,092** path-shaped strings in non-
markdown comments, most are not repository paths at all: MIME types, MCP
method names (``tools/call``), Splunk REST routes (``services/search/jobs``),
container images, URL routes, Go import paths. Flagging those would produce a
gate people learn to ignore, which is worse than none.

Three structural filters cut the corpus to the references that are actually
claims about this tree:

1. **A known file extension.** ``tools/call`` and ``services/ocsf`` are not
   files. This is also what excludes ``cost_telemetry._PRICING`` and
   ``graph_ws.Broadcaster``, which are attribute references wearing a slash.
2. **A first segment that names something at the top of this repository.**
   ``application/json`` and ``github.com/x/y`` do not survive it; the
   ``docs/…`` reference that started this does.
3. **Not a URL, not templated, not a glob, not gitignored.** A build artefact
   under ``dist/`` legitimately does not exist in a clean checkout.

A path is then resolved against the repository root *and* against each
ancestor of the file that mentions it, because a comment in
``services/agents/tests/`` naming a ``conftest.py`` under ``tests/`` means
the one beside it, not one at the root.

Measured blind spot, accepted on purpose
----------------------------------------
Extension-less directory references — ``infra/terraform/aws``,
``services/ocsf`` — are **not** checked. 286 of them resolve and 52 do not,
and hand-classifying the 52 put genuine rot at roughly one in five: the rest
are URL routes, API paths and tool names that happen to start with a
directory name. A gate at 20% precision is a gate that gets ignored, so this
one says what it skipped (see the summary it prints) rather than guessing.

Exceptions
----------
``ACCEPTED`` records the references that are deliberately unresolvable:
placeholders in usage text, and prose *about* a path that was removed or
moved. Each carries a reason and is checked in both directions — an entry
naming a reference that now resolves, or one that is no longer in the
corpus, fails the build rather than sitting there.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/check_comment_paths.py
    python3 scripts/check_comment_paths.py --list       # every reference read
    python3 scripts/check_comment_paths.py --self-test  # prove it still detects

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 the scan itself could not run.
