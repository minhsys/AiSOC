"""Competitor-naming gate.

AiSOC never names a competitor product — not in documentation, marketing copy,
plan files, code comments or release notes. Where a competitor is the benchmark
for a comparison the text refers to it neutrally and keeps the analytical
content: the capability compared, the direction of the gap, the magnitude.

The difficulty is that a vendor name is usually *correct* here. This product
ships 80+ connectors, so a connector module, a plugin manifest, a setup guide or
a normalizer profile naming its vendor is necessary. `Torq` is the clearest
case: it is simultaneously a first-party SOAR connector and a name that used to
appear in a competitive comparison matrix. A blind search-and-replace would
break working connector code.

So the gate never infers intent from prose. It works from two explicit lists in
`scripts/competitor_names.toml`:

  * `[[competitors]]` — the product names that may not appear, as regexes.
  * `[[allow]]`       — the integration surfaces where those names are expected,
                        by path, each naming which names it excuses and why.

Plus a third, narrower list: `[[comparison_surfaces]]` pins the published
comparison tables by literal start/end marker and checks them against a wider
vendor list. A comparison table is the one place where any vendor name is a
violation, including a vendor this product integrates with, because the table's
whole job is to position AiSOC against it. The integration allow-list does not
apply inside those regions.

Both lists are checked in both directions, because the dominant failure shape in
this repository is a check that compares A against B and never B against A, then
prints OK while drift accumulates:

  * a competitor pattern that matches nothing anywhere — including its own
    fixtures — is dead and fails, rather than silently excusing the tree;
  * an allow entry matching no file, or matching files that no longer contain
    any of the names it excuses, is a stale exemption and fails, so an exemption
    cannot outlive the code it excused;
  * a comparison-surface marker that no longer matches fails, rather than
    scanning an empty slice and reporting clean.

The scan root is resolved from the working directory (or `--root`), never from
this file's own location, and is printed along with the file count. A gate that
resolves its own repository can print a confident OK about a tree it never
inspected.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_competitor_names.py --self-test
    python3 scripts/check_competitor_names.py
    python3 scripts/check_competitor_names.py --root /path/to/worktree
