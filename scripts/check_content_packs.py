"""Every shipped pack resolves against the corpus this build ships.

Gap-closure wave 10.

A pack that references a rule id nobody ships is the exact failure the
format exists to prevent: an operator adopts it, nothing fires, and no
error appears anywhere. That is not hypothetical — rule ids were
positional until `detections/rule-ids.lock.json` pinned them, so an
insertion used to renumber everything after it.

So the references are checked against the **compiled ruleset the
engine loads**, not against the YAML on disk. The YAML is a
projection: `detections/*.yaml` carries thousands of rules the engine
never loads, and validating against it would certify a pack whose
detections cannot fire.
