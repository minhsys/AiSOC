"""Assert every install path for a package agrees with every other install path.

The failure this exists to prevent is "the same commit does not build the same
way twice". A service is installed from more than one place — its
``pyproject.toml``, its ``Dockerfile``, a ``poetry.lock``, and whichever CI
workflows pip-install its dependencies to run a test — and nothing compared
them. When they disagree, the thing CI tested and the thing the image ships are
different software, and the difference surfaces as a failure pointing at an
innocent file.

Two measured instances, both of which this gate now catches:

* ``sqlglot`` enforces tenant isolation on the ClickHouse lake. It was declared
  ``<31`` in ``services/api/pyproject.toml`` and ``<27`` in the Dockerfile and
  five workflows. sqlglot 27 renamed the SELECT's FROM key, so on the versions
  only pyproject allowed the rewriter returned queries with no tenant
  predicate — and reported success. CI installed the narrow range, so it could
  never see it.
* ``fastapi`` was declared ``>=0.111,<0.142`` in ``services/api/pyproject.toml``
  and ``>=0.111,<0.112`` in the Dockerfile's pip fallback, with no bound at all
  in six workflows. Every release from 0.111.0 to 0.116.2 refuses to import
  ``api/v1/endpoints/community.py``; on 2026-09-24 the fallback fired and the
  image shipped 0.111.1.

So the property enforced here is *agreement*, not any particular bound. Moving
a range is fine; moving it in one place is not.

Directions. The dominant failure shape in this repository is a one-directional
gate that compares A against B and never B against A, so drift in the direction
things actually change slips through while the gate prints OK. Every comparison
below therefore runs both ways, and ``--self-test`` injects drift in each
direction separately and asserts this file reports it:

  manifest -> image   a package the manifest declares must not be installed
                      at a different version by the image
  image -> manifest   a package the image installs must be declared by the
                      manifest (the direction the old fallback lists drifted)
  agreement           for a critical package, every range written anywhere
                      must normalise to the same range
  lock -> agreement   the version a lock actually resolved must satisfy that
                      range, so the file that decides what ships is compared
                      too rather than trusted
  unbounded           a path naming a critical package with no version bound
                      permits every version, including the broken ones
  manifest -> install an install path that drops an extra the manifest
                      declares installs a smaller dependency set than was
                      asked for, so CI tests different software than ships
  source -> manifest  code importing the module an extra enables, in a service
                      that does not declare the extra, resolves only while an
                      upstream accident keeps supplying it
  extra -> lock       an extra exists to install a package; a lock that
                      resolved without it makes the declaration decoration
  coverage            a file that declares a critical package and is not in
                      the scanned set fails, so adding an install path without
                      telling this gate is itself an error

# ── Extras are part of a dependency's identity ───────────────────────────────
#
# `sqlalchemy` and `sqlalchemy[asyncio]` are two different dependency sets, and
# a gate comparing only version ranges calls them the same thing. That is how
# `main` went red: the wave-1 service-test job installed a bare, unbounded
# `sqlalchemy` while `services/purple-team/pyproject.toml` declared
# `sqlalchemy[asyncio]`, and nothing compared the two. It passed anyway for
# months, because SQLAlchemy 2.0.x *also* required `greenlet` outside the extra
# whenever `platform_machine` matched — which it does on `ubuntu-latest`. So the
# extra was load-bearing and undeclared at the same time. 2.1.0 removed that
# clause, the unbounded install re-resolved onto it, and every import of
# `sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio` began failing at collection.
#
# The durable lesson is not about one package: an extra whose absence stays
# invisible until an upstream release changes its mind is exactly the drift
# this file exists to catch, so extras are now compared like ranges are.
