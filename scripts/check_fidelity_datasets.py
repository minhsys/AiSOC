"""Gate: every fidelity dataset is obtainable, and unmeasured floors say so.

Two of the four fidelity datasets shipped a downloader and two did not.
`ait_lds_loader.py` and `mitre_engenuity_loader.py` could parse the full
corpora from the day they landed, and there was no way to obtain either —
so the only numbers anyone could produce came from a ten-line micro
fixture. A micro fixture proves the loader parses. It says nothing about
how the classifier behaves at scale, which is the entire question a
fidelity benchmark exists to answer.

The asymmetry was invisible because each half looked complete on its own:
the loaders had tests, the fixtures had thresholds, and nothing compared
the set of loaders against the set of downloaders.

This checks three things:

  1. Every dataset with a loader has a downloader.
  2. Every downloader requires explicit licence acceptance. These are
     third-party corpora under attribution terms, and a script that
     fetches one without the operator reading them agrees to terms on
     their behalf.
  3. A threshold block marked `measured: false` is not presented
     anywhere as an observed result.
