"""Gate: every field the funnel endpoint returns is documented.

Eight fields shipped across v7.7 and v8.0 without reaching
`apps/docs/docs/console/funnel-kpis.md`. That matters more than a
documentation gap usually does, because of *which* eight: repeat-alert
suppression, abstention rate, ungrounded demotions and mean groundedness are
the fields that say whether the automation is working honestly. A number
nobody documents is a number nobody checks — and `repeat_alerts_suppressed`
reported a flat zero for an entire release without anyone noticing, because
the fingerprint bug meant no two alerts ever matched.

Parsed from the source rather than by importing the endpoint: the API
package pulls in SQLAlchemy, asyncpg, Neo4j and ClickHouse drivers, and a
documentation gate that needs a database container is a gate that gets
disabled.
