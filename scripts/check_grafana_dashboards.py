"""Gate: every dashboard panel queries a metric some service emits.

A panel for a metric nothing exports renders "No data" forever. That is
worse than having no panel, because it teaches people that empty panels are
normal — and once they believe that, a genuinely dead service looks exactly
like an uninstrumented one.

Also checks datasource references resolve. Grafana does not warn about a
dangling datasource uid: the panel just shows nothing, and a trace-to-metrics
link silently does nothing when clicked, which reads as "tracing is not
wired up" rather than as a typo. The Tempo datasource shipped pointing at
`aisoc-prometheus` before any datasource declared that uid.
