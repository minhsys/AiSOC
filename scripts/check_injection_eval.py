"""Phase 3: measure prompt-injection resistance, and gate the half that is deterministic.

One entry point for both halves on purpose. The deterministic guard rate and
the live-model rates are different claims about different things, but they
are rates over the *same* corpus, and two scripts computing them would be two
definitions of "detected" that drift. The model matrix next door is a thin
wrapper for exactly this reason and a test holds it to that shape.

What each half proves, stated here because the distinction is the whole point
of the phase:

**The CI floor measures the guard, not the model.** It answers "does
``PromptInjectionGuard`` still flag the payloads it flagged last week", which
is a regression sentinel for a deterministic pattern matcher. It says nothing
whatsoever about whether a model would have obeyed an injected instruction.
A reader who takes a green run here as evidence of a model's resistance has
been misled, so the published page separates them and this script refuses to
emit a behavioural rate it did not measure.

**The live rates measure the model**, and only the weekly wet eval can
produce them, because they are differences between two answers. Without a
funded key they read "not measured" and never ``0``. A degraded live run
(no key, agent stack not importable, no pair answered) yields unmeasured
rates rather than zeroed ones, which is asserted by
``tests/test_injection_eval_gate.py`` rather than left to this docstring.

Run:
    python3 scripts/check_injection_eval.py --check
    python3 scripts/check_injection_eval.py --live --json-out out.json
    python3 scripts/check_injection_eval.py --self-test
