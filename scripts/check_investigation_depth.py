"""Gate: investigations must actually investigate.

Pillar 2's failure mode is not that the code is absent — ``run_with_tools``
existed and worked for months with no production caller. It is that depth
silently disappears. A refactor drops the tool binding, a prompt change makes
the model answer in one turn, an exception handler swallows the loop, and
what ships is alert-enrich-summarise with an investigation's vocabulary. Every
narrative still reads plausibly, so nothing catches it.

This grades the structure of an investigation rather than its prose:

  1. Every strategy's ``expected_pivots`` must name a real tool. A strategy
     that asks for a tool nobody implements is guidance the model cannot
     follow.
  2. Every backed tool must be reachable from at least one strategy,
     otherwise it is dead weight the model pays context for.
  3. The loop must be wired into a production path. This is the specific
     regression that already happened once.
  4. Replayed investigations (when a corpus is supplied) must reach their
     strategy's pivot floor, with real distinct tools, inside budget.
