"""A run on `main` that ends `cancelled` must be visible, not silently accepted.

Why this exists
---------------
`check_workflow_concurrency.py` is prevention: it reads the workflow files and
refuses a concurrency block that can discard a push. This is detection, and
the two answer different questions. A workflow can be shaped correctly and
still lose runs — a manual cancel, a runner-pool eviction, a `timeout-minutes`
kill, an org-level concurrency limit, or a concurrency block added by a future
change the static gate has not learned to read.

The reason detection is needed at all is that a cancellation is invisible by
construction:

* the run's conclusion is `cancelled`, not `failure`, so nothing goes red;
* a job whose `needs:` dependency was cancelled never starts, so it produces
  no check run at all — absent is quieter still;
* the commit page shows a green tick from whatever *did* report, beside a
  commit that was never graded.

Measured on this repository before the concurrency fix: of the last 1,000
push-triggered runs on `main`, 259 ended `cancelled`, and only 51% of the
required-check x commit pairs over the last 30 commits actually graded.

What it asserts
---------------
No push-triggered run on `main` created after `SINCE` ended `cancelled`,
except in workflows that record cancellation as a deliberate trade. Those are
not silently skipped: their counts are printed every run, so an exception that
starts costing more than it is worth is visible rather than forgotten.

Non-vacuity
-----------
"Found nothing" and "asked nothing" print the same word, so:

* the repository under inspection is resolved from the checkout's own `origin`
  remote, after sentinel files prove the checkout is this repository. Taking
  it from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` alone would let the gate render a confident
  verdict about `beenuar/AiSOC` while standing in a directory holding nothing
  — the meta-gate probe that copies `scripts/` into an empty repository caught
  exactly that on the first draft of this file.
* the unwindowed fetch must return runs. Zero means the token, the repository
  or the API shape is wrong — that is a failure, not a clean repository.
* the window is reported separately from the fetch, and a window holding no
  runs yet says so loudly instead of rendering a verdict it did not earn.
* `--self-test` drives the classifier over a synthetic run list and asserts it
  separates cancelled from successful, honours the exception list, and refuses
  an empty fetch.

    python3 scripts/check_main_run_cancellations.py --self-test
    GH_TOKEN=... python3 scripts/check_main_run_cancellations.py
