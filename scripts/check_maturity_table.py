"""Every Stable row in the README's maturity table must have earned it.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
The Project maturity table published a status for fifteen capabilities and
**nothing checked any of them**. There was no definition of Stable, Beta or
Alpha anywhere in the repository, no gate parsed the table, and the labels
appeared in no other file. Promoting a capability was a one-line edit.

That is the claim shape this project exists to refuse. Phase 1.1 of the
parity plan retracted twelve published claims nothing checked; the maturity
table was the last large claim surface with no gate behind it. Worse, an
audit found three of its rows were already wrong — two describing live
database coverage that exists nowhere in CI, and one naming the wrong compose
profile.

The definition is in `docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md` and was read off the
four rows that already held Stable rather than invented, so no existing row
had to be demoted to fit a standard written after the fact.

What Stable requires
--------------------
1. **Unconditionally graded** — a PR check with no `paths:` filter and no
   `if:` guard that could skip it.
2. **Real production path** — the code a deployment runs, not a double.
3. **Proven able to fail** — a negative control.
4. **Real infrastructure** — containers, not in-memory SQLite with shims.

Why a registry rather than parsing the prose
---------------------------------------------
The `Tested` column is written for humans. A gate that tried to infer
evidence from it would either miss the row that matters or flag prose
forever — the reasoning `check_profile_service_counts.py` records about its
own list of exact sites. So each Stable row must name its evidence here, and
this gate verifies the named artefacts exist and hold the four properties.

It runs in **both directions**: an entry naming a row that is no longer
Stable, or pointing at a file that has been renamed or deleted, fails too. A
registry that only grows would accumulate stale entries implying coverage
nobody has.
