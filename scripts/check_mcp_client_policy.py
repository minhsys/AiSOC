"""Gate: the MCP client's defaults cannot quietly widen.

Gap-closure Phase 5.

An MCP server is somebody else's code, reached over the network, returning
text into the prompt that decides what the agent does next. Everything that
makes that safe is a *default* rather than a feature, and a default is exactly
the kind of thing a refactor moves without anybody noticing: an allowlist
check that drifts one line below the connection, a `Tool` built with a raw
callable so the dispatch re-check is skipped, a description passed through
because sanitising it broke a formatting test.

Seven properties, each checked in the direction it would actually drift.

  BEFORE-THE-WIRE    `app/mcp/policy.py` imports nothing that can perform I/O.
                     Every refusal this phase makes has to be reachable with
                     no socket, and the cheapest way to keep that true is to
                     make it impossible to write a policy that needs one.

  ALLOWLIST-FIRST    the first test in `vet_tool` is the allowlist. An
                     allowlist consulted after the annotation, the name or
                     anything else still refuses, but it means a tool nobody
                     named gets its other properties evaluated first, and the
                     property this phase claims is that it does not.

  SSRF-BEFORE-OPEN   `McpClient.session` calls `validate_outbound_url` before
                     it constructs a transport. A guard that runs after the
                     connection is an audit record, not a control.

  INVOKER-ONLY       every `Tool` built in `app/mcp/tools.py` is given an
                     `McpToolInvoker`. A raw callable would bypass the
                     dispatch-time re-check and the ledger write in one step.

  STDIO-OFF          `stdio_enabled` has no truthy default, and the command
                     allowlist is consulted separately. Either one alone
                     being enough would make a single environment variable
                     the difference between an HTTP client and a process
                     launcher.

  NO-DESTRUCTIVE     run the real policy over a destructive tool, an
                     un-allowlisted tool and a poisoned description, and
                     require a refusal for each. The five checks above are
                     structural; this one asks the code what it does.

  LEDGERED           the call, refusal and failure paths each write to the
                     ledger. A tool call nobody recorded is one nobody can
                     audit afterwards, which is the claim the phase makes.
