"""Every service module has a production importer, or a written reason.

Why this exists
---------------
The gates in this repository certify functions, not call paths. A claim row
can pass on a unit test of a module nothing imports, and that is not a
hypothetical failure: the capability review at `v14.0.0` found a large share
of the product built and dark. The hunting agent had no caller outside its
own test. `PostActionVerifier` had none at all. `run_with_tools` was a
working ReAct loop with zero production callers. The console's per-action
closure thresholds were read only by an unused module.

In each case a test passed, a claim row cited it, and the code never ran.

What "reachable" means here
---------------------------
A module is reachable when a path exists from an **entry point** to it
through ordinary imports. Entry points are the things a deployment actually
starts: a service's `main`, a worker, a CLI, a migration runner, a conftest
for the suites CI runs.

Test files are **not** entry points. That is the whole point: a module
imported only by its own test is exactly the shape this gate exists to
find, and counting the test would make the gate agree with the defect.

Dynamic imports
---------------
`importlib.import_module(name)` with a computed name cannot be followed
statically. Where a module is loaded that way, the loader is named in
`DYNAMIC_LOADERS` and the modules it reaches are treated as reachable from
it, so a plugin directory does not read as dead. A loader that stops being
used fails the gate, because the entry would then be excusing nothing.
