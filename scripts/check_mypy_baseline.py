"""Run mypy, and refuse to let the result get worse.

`ci.yml` has a job called **Python — Lint & Type-check**. It installed mypy
and never invoked it. Six manifests carry a `[tool.mypy]` table and three of
them set `strict = true`, so three authors explicitly asked for type checking
that has never once run. A tool in the install list that never executes
implies a check that is not happening, which is this repository's dominant
defect wearing yet another costume — a workflow green on eight consecutive
weekly runs with every real step skipped, a lint job printing "2/2 passed"
while 32 of 62 packs did not match, three check scripts wired into no
workflow at all.

Two honest options existed: stop installing mypy, or run it. Running it wins,
because the configuration says six trees want it.

What this does *not* do is soften the answer to make it pass. There is no new
`ignore_errors`, no added `ignore_missing_imports`, no `--no-strict-optional`,
and no tree excluded from the check. `strict = true` stays strict and the
tests are checked along with the source. The findings — 673 of them at the
time of writing — are recorded in `scripts/mypy_baseline.json` exactly as
mypy reports them, and the gate fails when any of them grows. A recorded
finding is reported; a suppressed one is hidden, and the difference is the
whole point.

The baseline is keyed on `(tree, file, error-code)`. A bare per-tree total
would let one error be introduced while an unrelated one is fixed, leaving
the count flat and the gate silent — the same "compares a tally against
everything except itself" shape that left a gate off by one while CI stayed
green.

Environment. mypy's answer depends on what is importable, so the baseline is
only meaningful against a fixed environment: **mypy alone, no project
dependencies installed, on the interpreter `ci.yml` uses**. That is what CI
does and what `--update` must be run under. Anything else produces a
different set of `import-untyped` findings and a baseline nobody can
reproduce.

Directions, because a one-directional gate is how drift escapes here:

  findings -> baseline  a finding not in the baseline, or more of one than
                        the baseline records, fails
  baseline -> findings  a baseline entry mypy no longer reports fails, so a
                        fixed error must be banked rather than left as
                        headroom for the next one
  config -> baseline    a tree declaring [tool.mypy] and absent from the
                        baseline fails, so adding a config does not quietly
                        add an unchecked tree
  baseline -> config    a baseline entry for a tree with no config fails
  tree -> config        a Python tree on disk that declares no [tool.mypy]
                        fails, so a new service is type-checked from its
                        first commit rather than from whenever somebody
                        notices
  config -> tree        a config, or a baseline entry, naming a tree that is
                        no longer on disk fails
  file -> scope         a Python file this repository tracks that no tree and
                        no scope covers fails

The last three are the coverage gate, and they exist because of what this
started as: six of twenty trees declared `[tool.mypy]`, and the job named
"Lint & Type-check" reported green over the fourteen it never opened. A tool
that appears to cover the repository while covering a third of it is
indistinguishable from no tool at all, only more reassuring. `tree -> config`
is the direction that catches a new service; `config -> tree` is the one that
rots quietly, because nothing ever fails when a stale entry is simply never
consulted.

Discovery is structural — every directory holding a `pyproject.toml` — not
`services/*` plus `packages/*`. The glob was a naming convention, and a
Python tree added anywhere else would have satisfied a coverage gate written
against the same glob while being checked by nothing, which is the shape this
file exists to refuse.

The unmanaged scope
-------------------
`tree -> config` asks whether every tree is configured. It cannot ask whether
every *file* is in a tree, and 153 were not: `scripts/`, `tests/`, `tools/`
and `plugins/` hold Python that belongs to no manifest, so giving all twenty
trees a `[tool.mypy]` table still left those unchecked. Most of them are
under `scripts/`, which is where the CI gates live — the code the rest of
this repository's claims are verified by was the only Python in it nothing
type-checked.

They are covered by a scoped invocation rather than by a repo-root manifest.
`mypy-unmanaged.toml` records the three measurements behind that choice; the
short version is that a root `pyproject.toml` makes `poetry check` invalid
from every directory without a manifest of its own, hands pytest a configfile
it did not have, and would be a 21st Python tree that the packaging gates
miss only because their globs stop at `services/*` + `packages/*`.

The scope is **computed, never listed**: `git ls-files '*.py'` minus every
manifest tree minus the archived prototype. A list would be a path-glob
convention wearing different clothes, and the file added outside it is
exactly the one a convention cannot see. Adding a script anywhere puts it in
scope with no edit; deleting a tree's manifest moves that tree's files into
this scope rather than out of coverage, so the two directions cannot both be
satisfied by removing something.

Scanned, not assumed. mypy is invoked with an explicit file list and
`--linecount-report`, and the run fails unless mypy's own report accounts for
every module asked of it. "Found nothing" and "opened nothing" print the same
word otherwise, which is the failure mode this file was written against.

#:
#: The interpreter is *not* the variable people assume. Every tree pins
#: ``python_version`` and this scope's config does too, so 3.13 against 3.11
#: moves exactly one finding; installing eight dependencies moves 59.
#:
#: ``--no-incremental`` closes the second one, which is subtler and was found
#: while measuring the first: a ``.mypy_cache`` written by an earlier run under
#: a *different* environment is reused by the next one, so the same tree
#: answered 990 on a cold cache and 988 on a cache a dependency-installed run
