"""Refuse a second case table, and refuse a second status vocabulary.

Gap-closure wave 1.

The product shipped with two case tables that never synchronised. The
console wrote `aisoc_cases`; `resolution_time`, `metrics`, `insights`,
`executive_digest`, `mssp_portfolio` and the GraphQL layer all read
`cases`. **Every case an analyst created was invisible to every case
metric** — MTTR could sit at null while a tenant closed cases all week.

Nothing failed. Both tables existed, both sets of queries were valid,
and the only symptom was a number that stayed empty for a reason no
error message gave. That is what this gate exists to make loud.

Two questions, because the split had two halves
-------------------------------------------------
**One table.** No module may read or write `cases` as a bare table name.
Migration 083 renamed it `cases_pre_consolidation`, which is allowed:
keeping the pre-consolidation rows readable is deliberate, since a
migration that lost a row nobody noticed is worse than two tables.

**One vocabulary.** The readers filtered `status == "open"` and
`status == "in_progress"`, neither of which the console's state machine
can produce, so those counters were structurally zero. Status literals
now come from `app.services.case_status`, and a bare literal outside
that module is refused.

The second check is the one that matters more. Consolidating the tables
without consolidating the vocabulary would leave the counters just as
wrong, on one table instead of two.
