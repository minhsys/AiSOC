"""There is one permission model, and the database is authoritative.

Two shipped side by side. 275 route dependencies called the synchronous
`require_permission`, reading the hardcoded `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` map; 27
called `require_permission_db`, reading the `user_roles` /
`role_permissions` tables the console's RBAC screen writes to. An operator
could grant a permission, watch it appear in the UI, and have 275 of 302
routes ignore it.

The fix made the one factory they all already call read what authentication
resolved from the database, so there is nothing left to edit per route —
and nothing left for this gate to count. What it checks instead is that the
single path stays single:

1. **`CurrentUser.require_permission` consults the resolved set.** If it
   goes back to reading only the static map, every route silently reverts.
2. **`get_current_user` resolves one.** A principal built without it falls
   through to the static map by design, which is right for a test double
   and wrong for a real session.
3. **Every RBAC write invalidates.** A grant that does not bump the version
   leaves stale permissions cached on every replica, and for a *revoke*
   that is the dangerous direction.
4. **The static map is not read directly by route modules.** One importer
   is the resolver's bootstrap path; a second is a route deciding for
   itself, which is how the second model gets rebuilt.

Each is checked structurally with `ast`, because every one of them is a
question about which function calls which, and a text search cannot tell a
call from a mention in a docstring.
