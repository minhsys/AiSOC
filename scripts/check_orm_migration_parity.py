"""Every column a model declares must be a column some migration creates.

Why this exists
---------------

``services/ueba/app/models/ueba.py`` declared ``EntityBaseline.peer_group_id``
and migration ``0001`` never created it. SQLAlchemy names every mapped column
in its ``SELECT``, so the *first* database call UEBA's scoring path makes
raised ``UndefinedColumnError``. UEBA could therefore never write a baseline
or an anomaly, on any deployment, from the day the column was added — and
because the consumer had no ``except``, the container stayed ``running`` with
``/health`` answering 200 the whole time.

Two more of the same kind were in the same three tables:
``ueba_peer_groups.id`` was created ``UUID`` and declared ``String(64)`` while
the code wrote ``dept:engineering`` into it, and ``ueba_anomalies.event_type``
was created 64 characters wide and declared 128.

None of this needed a database to find. The model and the migration are both
in the tree, and the disagreement is structural. That is what this reads.

What it checks, in both directions
----------------------------------

``missing-in-migration``
    A model declares a column no migration creates. This is the direction
    that breaks at runtime, and it breaks on the first query rather than on
    some rare path, because the column list is in the ``SELECT``.

``missing-in-model``
    A migration creates a column no model declares. Not a crash, so it is
    reported separately and carries a recorded reason — but it is checked,
    because a gate that only looks one way passes while drift accumulates in
    the other. Three of the four cases here turned out to be
    ``server_default`` columns nothing maps, and one was a table whose model
    had been renamed.

``type-narrower-in-migration``
    Both sides have the column and the database's is too small to hold what
    the model will send. ``String(64)`` in a table against ``String(128)`` in
    the model passes every test that inserts a short value.

``no-migration-source``
    A model declares a table **no migration anywhere mentions**. This is the
    finding that exists because of how this gate could have been useless: a
    table the parser fails to pair contributes zero column comparisons, and
    zero findings over zero comparisons prints the same word as a clean
    result. ``--credits`` exists for the same reason — it enumerates what
    each verdict was *based on*, so a parser that silently credits nothing
    can be caught by reading rather than by trusting the exit code.

What it reads
-------------

Structurally, both sides. Models: Python ``ast`` over
``services/*/app/**`` for classes carrying ``__tablename__``, collecting
``mapped_column`` / ``Column`` assignments. Migrations: Python ``ast`` over
each alembic chain for ``op.create_table`` / ``op.add_column`` /
``op.drop_column``, plus the raw-SQL statements those revisions and
``services/api/migrations/*.sql`` execute, because half the column additions
in this repository are ``ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`` inside a
string.

Usage
-----

::

    python3 scripts/check_orm_migration_parity.py           # table + verdict
    python3 scripts/check_orm_migration_parity.py --check    # gate
    python3 scripts/check_orm_migration_parity.py --credits  # what it credited
    python3 scripts/check_orm_migration_parity.py --json
    python3 scripts/check_orm_migration_parity.py --self-test

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 the scan itself could not run.
