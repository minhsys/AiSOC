"""Gate: the published playbook schema and the engine that runs playbooks
must describe the same product.

``schemas/playbook.schema.json`` is the contract authors are told to trust.
When it drifts from ``services/agents/app/playbook/``, a playbook validates
and then fails at runtime — the worst shape for a schema to have, because the
failure lands on the person who did exactly what the documentation said.

Before this gate the two had drifted in every available direction at once:

  * two schema files existed with different step vocabularies (15 types and
    9 types) against an engine with 22, and the drafter silently fell back
    from one to the other;
  * 11 step types were declared by a schema and implemented nowhere;
  * 13 step types were accepted by the engine and declared by no schema;
  * 12 of those had no handler and the engine reported them ``SUCCESS``,
    including ``approval`` — a human gate that auto-passed;
  * 32 of 64 shipped playbooks failed the published schema, while the lint
    job printed ``2/2 passed`` because it only ever looked at two files.

Every comparison here runs in **both** directions. A check that only asks
"does the schema declare something the engine lacks" passes forever while
drift accumulates in the direction things actually change — the engine grows
a verb and nobody tells the schema. That is how a sibling gate in this repo
reported "OK" on a YAML file declaring 17 labels against Go code with 28.

The fifth vocabulary, and why the file list is not written down
---------------------------------------------------------------
This gate used to name the two TypeScript facts it cared about: the union in
``packages/types``. It never opened ``apps/web``, where the playbook editor
declared a nine-member union of its own under a header comment claiming it
mirrored the engine's twenty-two. Keying its form registry
``Record<StepType, StepSchema>`` on that local union meant exhaustiveness was
satisfied with thirteen forms missing, so the compiler was quiet and the gate
was looking somewhere else. The one step type an operator could actually
click was the one nothing checked.

Naming ``apps/web/src/components/playbooks/stepSchemas.ts`` here would fix
that file and leave the next one free. So the TypeScript half is a **scan**:
every ``.ts``/``.tsx`` file in the tree is parsed for collections of step-type
literals, and any collection that overlaps the engine's vocabulary is required
either to match it exactly or to be a recorded subset with a reason. A sixth
vocabulary is a failing build wherever somebody puts it.

What the scan credits, and what it cannot see
---------------------------------------------
``--list`` prints every collection it found and the verdict it reached, which
is the only way to tell a gate that found nothing from one that looked
nowhere. Two limits, stated because an unstated limit is a blind spot:

* A collection overlapping the vocabulary by fewer than two members is not
  treated as a vocabulary. ``new Set<StepType>(['close_case'])`` is a
  predicate about one verb, not a restatement of the list.
* The parser reads array elements, object keys and string-literal union
  members. A vocabulary assembled at runtime — by ``.map()`` over something
  else, or spread from another module — is not a literal and is not seen.
  Deriving one from ``STEP_SCHEMAS`` is how the editor's palette and canvas
  metadata are written, and that is the shape this gate wants to encourage:
  derived lists cannot drift, so not seeing them costs nothing.
