"""Gate: the published compose-profile service counts match the compose file.

Five documents publish how many services each profile starts, and until this
gate existed nothing compared any of them to ``docker-compose.yml``. That is
the shape this repository keeps paying for: a number copied into prose goes
stale silently, and a reader has no way to tell a current figure from one that
was true two releases ago. ADR-0006 found exactly this while editing the same
table for a different reason: the published ``full`` count was 30, which is
every profile at once rather than what ``make up-full`` starts.

Derived from the YAML rather than from ``docker compose config``, for two
reasons. CI has no Docker daemon in the jobs that would want to run this, and
``docker compose`` resolves ``.env``, so the answer would depend on the
caller's environment rather than on the tree.

What it checks, in both directions:

  1. Every documented count equals the count the compose file implies.
  2. Every profile a document names still exists in the compose file, so a
     renamed profile fails as a stale reference rather than passing because
     nothing matched it.
  3. ``actions`` is reachable from the ``chatops`` profile, because
     ``slack-bot`` declares a dependency on it and a compose file whose
     dependency is outside the profile fails to render at all. ADR-0007 moved
     ``actions`` out of every profile list to satisfy this, and "it is in no
     list" is precisely the state a future edit would undo by adding one back.
