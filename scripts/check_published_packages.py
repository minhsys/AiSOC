"""Ask the registries what was published, rather than the workflow.

Why this exists
---------------
On the v12.2.0 release run all 59 jobs reported success, eight of them named
`npm — publish …` or `PyPI — publish …`, and all eight packages returned 404.
Only the final upload step is credential-gated, so each job built the
artefact, reached the upload, skipped it, and exited 0. The signal said nine
packages shipped and nothing had.

The credential gate is correct — the blocker is an account action, not code —
so the answer is not to publish but to stop inferring publication from a green
job. "The job ran" and "the registry holds the package" are different facts
and only the first was ever checked. This checks the second.

What it enforces
----------------
`.github/release-packages.yml` declares every package `release.yml` uploads
and whether each is expected to be on its registry. Three directions, because
a gate that only runs one way passes while drift accumulates in the other —
the recurring defect in this tree:

  manifest <-> workflow    Both ways. A package the npm/PyPI matrices build
                           and the manifest does not declare is a package
                           nothing will ever check; a package declared with no
                           matrix entry is a claim with no pipeline behind it.

  published: true  -> registry resolves, at the version in the tree. This is
                      the direction a release run cannot check itself: a job
                      that claims a publish and uploaded nothing fails here.

  published: false -> registry 404s. So the knowingly-absent set shrinks in a
                      commit when a credential arrives, instead of quietly
                      ceasing to be true. A stale `false` is as wrong as a
                      stale `true`; it is just wrong in the flattering
                      direction.

It also holds the prose to the same answer: `README.md`'s maturity row and
each package README's install command. Those used to be checked by a second
hardcoded package list in `tests/test_package_install_claims.py`, which could
disagree with this one. That test now imports this module, so there is one
list, one registry query, and one verdict.

Offline it skips rather than fails, because a contributor on a plane must not
be told the README is wrong when the truth is that the network is absent. The
structural checks above run first and do not need a network, so an offline run
still catches manifest/workflow drift.
