"""No route module keeps state in a module global, or serves invented data.

Why this exists
---------------
`check_mock_data_gated.py` scans `apps/web/src` and nothing else, so the same
two defects on the Python side had no gate at all:

**Shared mutable state.** A `dict` or `list` at module scope that a handler
writes to is one object for the whole process, shared by every tenant and
lost on restart. `copilot.py` kept conversations in `_CONVERSATIONS` and
listed them with no principal and no tenant filter, so one tenant could read,
append to and delete another's; `hunt_search.py` had the same shape for saved
searches. Neither is a caching bug. A module global has no tenant, so a
handler that writes to one has already lost the ability to scope the read.

**Fabricated data outside demo mode.** `shifts.py` served three invented
shifts with named analysts and a fake ticket id from a module-level list, and
`stix_taxii.py` served invented indicators, bundles and collections. Both were
reachable with demo mode off.

Why a sibling rather than an extension
--------------------------------------
The brief asked for `check_mock_data_gated.py` to be extended. That file is
1,181 lines of rules written against TypeScript syntax — SWR `fallbackData`,
nullish fallbacks reaching a mock, demo factories, catch-block literals.
Python has none of those shapes and has one the console does not: a mutable
module global. Extending would have meant a second rule engine inside a file
whose every existing rule stayed inapplicable. Recorded as a deviation.

This gate parses with `ast` rather than matching text, because the question
is "does a function body assign to a name bound at module scope", and that is
a scope question a regex cannot answer.
