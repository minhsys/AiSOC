"""Every table and column a raw SQL statement names must be one a migration creates.

Why this exists
---------------

``services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/rule_tuning.py`` inserts an auto-tuner
proposal with a raw ``sqlalchemy.text()`` statement naming fourteen columns of
``detection_rule_proposals``. One of them, ``source``, is created by no
migration in this repository — not in ``010_detection_as_code.sql`` where the
table is defined, not in ``039_detection_proposal_github_pr.sql`` where it is
altered, not anywhere. The statement raises ``UndefinedColumnError`` on the
first row it tries to write, so the human-approval-gated tuning loop cannot
produce a single proposal on any deployment. This gate found it.

Nothing about that needed a database. The statement and the migrations are
both in the tree and the disagreement is structural, which is the same
observation ``check_orm_migration_parity.py`` was written on: UEBA declared
``EntityBaseline.peer_group_id``, migration ``0001`` never created it, and
UEBA could not write a baseline or an anomaly from the day the column was
added. That gate reads ORM-declared models. A raw ``text()`` string is
invisible to it, so the identical failure class had no gate at all over 107
raw statements naming 44 tables — and 35 of those 44 have no ORM model in the
tree at all, so raw SQL is the only thing that writes them and nothing was
checking it.

Two things hid it for as long as they did.

*The claim that a real database already exercised it.* The claim-to-gate
matrix recorded the analyst-disposition tuning loop as ``PARTIAL`` with the
gap "end-to-end proposal insert exercised in api integration, not a unit DB",
which reads as thin coverage of something that does run. No job runs
``services/api/tests/`` against a real database. ``Python — Tests`` in
``ci.yml`` declares no ``postgres`` service and sets
``DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://x:x@localhost/x``, a deliberate
non-database. ``integration.yml`` and ``upgrade-test.yml`` are the only
workflows with a live Postgres, and the single API test either of them runs is
``services/api/tests/test_mssp_portfolio_isolation.py``. The insert had never
touched a database anywhere.

*A test that greps for the table name.* ``test_wave1_loop_edges.py`` asserted
``"detection_rule_proposals" in str(db.execute.await_args.args[0])``. Being a
substring test it also passes on ``aisoc_detection_rule_proposals``, which
contains the right name inside the wrong one — and that exact confusion is
recorded history here: three insert sites and two tests had codified the
``aisoc_``-prefixed spelling of this very table. A mocked session cannot fail
on a column, so the assertion had nothing else to check.

What it checks, in both directions
----------------------------------

``unknown-table``
    ``INSERT INTO t`` or ``UPDATE t SET`` naming a table no migration creates.
    This is the ``aisoc_detection_rule_proposals`` class exactly, and unlike
    the substring assertion it cannot be satisfied by a name that merely
    contains the right one.

``unknown-column``
    A column in an ``INSERT`` column list, or on the left of a ``SET`` in an
    ``UPDATE`` or an ``ON CONFLICT … DO UPDATE``, that no migration creates on
    that table. ``detection_rule_proposals.source`` is this.

``unparsed-statement``
    The other direction, and the one that decides whether this gate is worth
    anything: a statement whose table or column list is assembled at runtime
    contributes zero comparisons, and zero findings over zero comparisons
    prints the same word as a clean result. Rather than skipping those
    quietly, each is a finding until it is recorded in ``DYNAMIC_SQL`` below
    with a reason. The list is checked in both directions, so an entry nothing
    needs any more fails the build instead of sitting there looking like
    coverage.

``--credits`` exists for the same reason: it enumerates what each verdict was
based on, so a parser that has silently stopped matching can be caught by
reading rather than by trusting the exit code.

What it reads
-------------

Statements: Python ``ast`` over ``services/*/app/**/*.py``, every string
constant and f-string in the module rather than only the arguments of
``text()`` — the SQL in ``services/fusion/app/services/alert_sink.py`` and
``services/agents/app/hunt/store.py`` is a module-level constant that
something else wraps later, and a gate keyed on the call site would not see
either. An f-string renders with ``{}`` where its interpolations were, which
is how a runtime-assembled table or column list becomes visible as one.

Schema: the migration parsers in ``check_orm_migration_parity.py``, imported
rather than reimplemented. Two parsers of the same DDL drift the first time
either learns something the other has not, and this repository has the scars:
its graph-schema check declared OK while one side had 17 labels and the other
28. Reusing them also fixed two gaps that only a column-level reader would
notice — a ``--`` comment line swallowed the column definition after it, and
``ALTER TABLE … RENAME COLUMN`` was never applied, so four ``connectors``
columns were known to the parser under names nothing in the tree uses.

Scope: every service with an ``app/`` directory, which on today's tree is 893
modules yielding 107 statements — ``api`` 75, ``agents`` 20, ``fusion`` 5,
``actions`` 3, ``slack-bot`` 2, ``osquery-tls`` 1, ``ueba`` 1. Small enough to
triage one by one, so nothing is narrowed to keep the number down.

The schema is the union of every migration source in the repository — 85 SQL
files under ``services/api/migrations`` plus the four alembic chains, 131
tables and 1,582 columns — because it is one Postgres. ``services/agents`` and
``services/fusion`` own no migrations and write to tables ``services/api``
creates, so a per-service comparison would have reported every one of their
25 statements as unsourced.
