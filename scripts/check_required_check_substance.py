"""A required check that reports success must have executed its assertions.

Why this exists
---------------
`check_workflow_concurrency.py` refuses a workflow shape that can discard a
push. `check_main_run_cancellations.py` reports a run on `main` that ended
`cancelled`. Both are about a grading that never happened *and said so*. This
is the third shape, and it is the quiet one: the run happens, the check is
green, and the work inside it was skipped.

Measured on this repository before the fix (`--window-runs 100`, successful
push runs on `main`, 2026-09-25 to 2026-09-29 — the numbers this gate prints):

    Backup → destroy → restore (Postgres via S3)   26 of 100 substantive
    docker compose up — full stack                 73 of 100 substantive
    the other 20 required checks                  100 of 100 substantive

On the runs it skipped, the disaster-recovery gate executed one step —
"Nothing under the disaster-recovery path changed" — and reported the same
green tick as the ones that seeded, backed up, destroyed and restored a
database. `docs/audit/CLAIM_TO_GATE_MATRIX.md` cites that check as the GATED
evidence for backup encryption, so the tick was standing in for a rehearsal
that had mostly not been held.

What it asserts
---------------
For every context in `.github/required-checks.json`, over successful
push-triggered runs on the protected branch created at or after
`enforced_from`:

* the job that produces the check was not itself skipped; and
* no step that *could* have run, ran not; and
* no step reported `failure` while the job stayed green (`continue-on-error`).

"Could have run" is decided by `scripts/gh_expr.py`, which evaluates each
step's `if:` under a simulated push to the protected branch:

    TRUE     unconditional — must have run
    UNKNOWN  gated on something only the run knows (a change filter, a job
             output) — on a protected-branch push it must be observed to have
             run, because this is precisely the class a path filter switches
             off
    FALSE    cannot run on such a push (`failure()`, `cancelled()`,
             `github.event_name == 'pull_request'`) — correctly skipped, and
             not reported

That is the "genuinely not applicable" versus "skipped where it should have
run" distinction, and it is *derived from the workflow* rather than asserted
by a list of step names. A list would go stale on the first rename, silently,
which is the same class of defect as the one being fixed.

Non-vacuity
-----------
Every way this gate could report OK without doing its work is closed, because
that is the failure mode it exists to catch:

* the repository is resolved from the checkout's own `origin` remote after
  sentinel files prove the checkout is this repository — a gate that trusts
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` will describe `beenuar/AiSOC` while standing in an
  empty directory;
* a missing token is a failure, not a skip;
* every context in the manifest must resolve to a real job in a real workflow
  file. A renamed job fails here rather than being silently dropped;
* the manifest must match branch protection whenever the token can read it
  (`administration: read`, which `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be granted). When it
  cannot, the gate says so in its output rather than implying it verified;
* the unwindowed fetch must return runs for each workflow;
* a context with zero runs in the enforced window is tolerated only while the
  window is younger than `YOUNG_WINDOW_DAYS`; after that, silence is a
  failure, because a required check that stopped running is the loudest
  version of this same defect;
* `--self-test` drives the classifier over a synthetic pre-fix job and asserts
  it fails, then over the post-fix shape and asserts it passes.
