"""Fail if an RLS policy would make a cross-tenant worker silently see nothing.

The arm this is about
---------------------
Every policy in this schema is written::

    USING (tenant_id = current_tenant_id() OR current_tenant_id() IS NULL)

The second clause is not decoration. Ingest, fusion, the retention purge, the
hunt scheduler's sweep and tenant deletion all read across every tenant on a
connection that never binds one, and the ``IS NULL`` arm is what lets them.
Drop it from one policy and that table quietly returns zero rows to those
workers — no error, no log line, just a purge that purges nothing and a
scheduler that fires nothing.

That mattered less while the services connected as a superuser, because a
superuser ignores policies entirely. ``061_runtime_app_role.sql`` moves them
onto a role the policies apply to, which makes the arm load-bearing in
production rather than in theory. **A worker that silently stops seeing data is
a worse failure than the bypass that change closes**, so the arm is now a gate.

The second bug class, kept closed
---------------------------------
``060_rls_coverage.sql`` repaired seven policies that could never engage: five
read ``app.tenant_id`` or ``app.current_tenant`` — GUCs no code path sets, so
they returned zero rows forever — and two called ``current_setting`` without
``missing_ok``, so an unbound session raised ``unrecognized configuration
parameter`` instead of returning anything. Both are invisible behind a
superuser. ``tests/isolation/test_postgres_rls.py`` catches them in a live
database; this catches them in the four schema chains that live database never
sees, because CI applies only the API chain.

Supersession is followed, not ignored
-------------------------------------
The broken definitions are still in the tree — 005, 007, 024 and 049 contain
them, and 060 drops and recreates each one. A scanner that read every
``CREATE POLICY`` in the repository would report seven findings that were
already fixed, and would then be silenced with an ignore list that outlives
its reason. So the chain is replayed in order: ``DROP POLICY`` removes an
entry, ``CREATE POLICY`` adds one, and only the surviving set is judged.

Both directions
---------------
* forward — a live policy with no fail-open arm fails.
* reverse — a live policy reading a GUC nothing sets, or omitting
  ``missing_ok``, fails. Same class from the other side: one returns nothing
  to a worker, the other returns nothing to a tenant.
* reverse — a schema file that enables row-level security but from which no
  policy could be parsed fails as a **blind spot**. The failure mode of a
  scanner is silence.
* reverse — a table with a policy but no ``FORCE`` fails: without it the owner
  walks past, and the owner is the role that runs migrations.

Empty input is a failure. A run that parsed no schema file has verified
nothing, and a probe recently found five wired gates reporting OK against an
empty repository.

Checked against a real database
-------------------------------
The surviving set this produces for the API chain was compared against
``pg_policies`` on a ``postgres:16`` with that chain applied: 84 here, 82
there, and the difference is fully accounted for. ``002_rls.sql`` guards two
policies behind ``IF EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables …)``, and
neither table existed when 002 ran — ``playbooks`` is never created by any
migration, and ``audit_log`` arrives in 004 and gets its policy there under a
different name. A text replay cannot evaluate a runtime condition, so the
static set is a **superset** of the live one. That is the safe direction: it
judges the shape of a policy that may not exist, rather than missing one that
does. ``tests/isolation/test_postgres_rls.py`` is what checks the live set.
