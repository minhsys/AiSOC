"""Every route that confers authority must decide whether the caller may.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
``POST /api/v1/tenants/me/users`` wrote a client-supplied ``role`` string into
``users.role`` — the column every ``require_permission`` reads — with no
allow-list and no comparison against the caller's own authority. Because
``platform_admin`` and ``admin`` are declared ``["*"]``, a ``tenant_admin``
could create an account holding every permission in the product
(GHSA-pm3f-h6gc-rvgp).

Five more routes had the same defect and the report named one, which is the
shape this repository keeps finding: the fix is applied where the finding
points and the siblings keep shipping. So the thing enforced here is not "this
handler validates its input" but the property that makes enumeration
unnecessary — **no principal confers authority it does not itself hold** —
and the check is that every role-conferring write reaches the one place that
decides it.

Three directions, because a one-directional gate passes while drift goes the
way things actually change:

*forward*
    A handler writes a role, scope or membership field from request data and
    never reaches ``app.core.role_grants``. This is the defect itself.

*reverse*
    An allow-list entry names a handler that no longer writes a role. A
    waiver covering nothing is a waiver nobody will notice is load-bearing
    when the handler comes back.

*vocabulary*
    A role is added to ``ROLE_PERMISSIONS`` and nothing classifies it, or a
    grantable role acquires the wildcard, or ``app/services/scim/roles.py``
    goes back to keeping its own copy of the list. The last one matters
    because SCIM had already refused wildcard roles from a directory group
    while the tenant API shipped without the rule; two lists that agree today
    are two lists that disagree later.
