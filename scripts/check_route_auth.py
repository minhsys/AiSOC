"""Default-deny: every route authenticates, or is public for a recorded reason.

``check_route_tenant_scope.py`` asks a conditional question — *if* a route
takes a tenant, where did the tenant come from. That leaves the larger set
untouched: a route that takes no tenant was never in its reach, and an
unauthenticated route that takes no tenant is still an unauthenticated route.
``POST /api/v1/playbooks/{id}/run`` on ``services/agents`` took no tenant and
executed a response playbook against the estate for any caller on the network.

So this gate inverts the default. Every route must either carry an
authentication dependency or appear in one of three tables below, each of
which records *why* it is reachable without one:

``PUBLIC_MODULES``
    Whole modules that exist to be probed — the shared liveness/readiness
    module. Keyed by path, not by handler name, because classifying a route
    as a health check by calling it ``health`` is a naming convention, and a
    naming convention is the thing that drifts.
``PUBLIC_ROUTES``
    Individual routes that are public by design: the sign-in flow, the
    identity-provider callbacks, a deliberately published replay. Each entry
    carries its reason.
``IN_BAND_CREDENTIAL_ROUTES``
    Routes whose credential is verified *inside the handler* rather than by
    a dependency — an HMAC signature, a signed callback payload, a
    single-use token. An AST pass sees no ``Depends`` and calls these
    unauthenticated; they are not. The exemption is **conditional**: it names
    the verifier and only holds while the handler still calls it. Delete the
    verification and the route is reported, which is the failure an
    unconditional allowlist cannot catch.

Two counts in this repository were wrong for exactly that last reason.
``slack-bot`` was reported as five unauthenticated routes: three are probes,
and the other two verify a Slack request signature and a shared internal
token in-band. ``teams-bot``'s webhook verifies an HMAC-signed card payload
with a replay window. Neither was ever open.

Both directions
---------------
* forward — an unauthenticated route with no entry fails;
* reverse — an entry that no longer matches a real unauthenticated route
  fails as stale, and an in-band entry whose verifier the handler stopped
  calling fails too. Exemptions therefore shrink as routes are secured,
  rather than accumulating as a list of things somebody once found
  inconvenient.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_route_auth.py              # gate
    python scripts/check_route_auth.py --inventory  # per-service table
    python scripts/check_route_auth.py --json
    python scripts/check_route_auth.py --self-test

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 violations, 2 the scan itself could not run.
