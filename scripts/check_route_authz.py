"""Ratchet: state-changing API routes that authenticate but never authorize.

``check_route_auth.py`` asks whether a route authenticates. That question was
answered "yes" for every route in ``remediation.py``, and a ``viewer`` could
still raise the tenant's autonomy tier to L4, pre-approve a high blast-radius
verb with no expiry, and suppress a containment verb mid-incident
(GHSA-wj5c-88hg-5926). Authentication had been standing in for authorization,
and the gate that would have noticed was asking the other question.

So this one asks: does a state-changing route make an *authorization* decision
at all? A route that only resolves an identity is counted, because "is this a
valid session?" is not "may this session do this?".

Why a count and not a list
--------------------------
The honest answer on the day this was written is that many routes are in this
state, and most are not defects — a handful are genuinely self-scoped (a
caller editing their own preferences, their own passkeys, their own on-call
status), and the rest need a per-route decision by someone who knows what the
route is for. Enumerating them here would be a list of things somebody once
found inconvenient, and it would be wrong within a week.

A ceiling is honest about that. It cannot rise: a new ungated route fails the
gate on the pull request that adds it. And it must not be *stale* either — if
the real count drops below the ceiling the gate fails too, demanding the
ceiling come down with it, so the number only ever moves toward zero.

``MAX_UNAUTHORIZED`` is not a target. It is a debt balance.

Usage::

    python scripts/check_route_authz.py              # gate
    python scripts/check_route_authz.py --inventory  # per-module table
    python scripts/check_route_authz.py --json
    python scripts/check_route_authz.py --self-test  # prove it detects drift

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 violations, 2 the scan itself could not run.

#:
#: Four routes under `/mssp/organizations` remain in this count and are not
#: debt: they authorize through `_admin_scope`, an organisation owner/admin
#: check, which is the right vocabulary for a portfolio-scoped act and is not
#: interchangeable with a tenant role. This gate reads `require_permission`
#: only, so it cannot see them; `test_mssp_route_permissions.py` asserts they
#: still resolve that scope.

#: Modules whose state-changing routes are authorized *by identity*, with the

#:
#: Declared per module rather than counted, because "20 remaining" tells a
#: reviewer nothing and this tells them exactly what is excused and why. The

#: already-listed module would not be caught by the list alone.
#:
#: Checked in both directions — a module that stops having identity-only
#: routes must lose its entry, or the list becomes a place excuses go to
