"""No two handlers register the same method and path in one app.

The blind spot this fills
------------------------
`check_route_shadowing.py` is a static AST pass, deliberately: one run reads
every service without needing any of them importable. Its own docstring
records what that costs, at line 27:

    Two modules included under one prefix can shadow each other and this
    will not see it.

That is not a theoretical gap. `services/agents` registered
`GET /api/v1/investigations/{run_id}` **twice**, from `app/api/router.py`
and `app/api/investigate.py`, each reading its own in-memory store. The one
included first answered every request, from the store the other module
writes, so console status polling returned 404 for runs that existed while
the sibling report routes under the same prefix worked.

The static pass could not see it for two reasons, both structural: it groups
by `(service, path, router)` and the two declared paths differ before
mounting (`/investigations/{run_id}` against `/api/v1/investigations/{run_id}`,
because one prefix comes from an app-level `include_router` the AST never
sees), and its `shadows()` only fires when a parameter segment faces a
literal one, so two identical paths compare equal and report nothing.

So this is the runtime half. It imports each app and reads the assembled
route table, which is the only place the prefixes are resolved.

Why it reads `app.router.routes` and counts what it found
---------------------------------------------------------
`app.openapi()` is the right corpus for asking *which paths exist*, and the
wrong one here: it keys paths in a dict, so a duplicate is silently
collapsed into one entry, which is exactly the thing being looked for.

Reading the router instead carries a known hazard. On FastAPI 0.141.x
`include_router` leaves an opaque object in `app.routes` and the `APIRoute`
count is zero, which has already made one gate in this repository compare
zero pairs and report success over an app serving 456 operations. So an app
that yields no routes is a failure here, not a pass.

    Not a fix for an observed hang. A CI job appeared stuck on this step
    for ninety minutes and the diagnosis was that a grandchild holding the

    by reproducing the shape and watching the plain call time out in three
    seconds. The job had in fact completed in 23 minutes and the GitHub
    API was reporting a stale state.

    Kept anyway, for two reasons that stand on their own: killing the
    process group closes every inherited pipe rather than only the child's,
    which is correct even where the plain call happens to cope; and
    `stdin` is closed, so a probe that decides to prompt dies instead of
    waiting. The timeout also drops from 240s to 90s, which caps the worst
