"""Keep the SCIM surface honest about itself, in both directions.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
SCIM has an unusual property for a write surface: the client decides what to
attempt by reading a document the server publishes. ``ServiceProviderConfig``
says whether PATCH works, whether filtering works, whether bulk works. An
identity provider reads it once at setup and configures itself accordingly.

That makes the discovery documents a claim, and a claim with no gate behind it
drifts. Two directions, both of which have a concrete failure:

*forward*
    The config advertises something the router does not implement. A provider
    configures itself to use it, and an administrator sees failed syncs whose
    cause is a JSON document rather than the code they are reading.

*reverse*
    The router grows an operation the config does not advertise. The provider
    never attempts it, so the capability is dead on arrival while every test
    for it passes. This is the shape that has repeated across this program:
    the mechanism exists, is tested, and nothing calls it.

Beyond the documents, two more disagreements would each be silent:

*role vocabulary*
    ``app.services.scim.roles`` maps directory groups onto the roles
    ``ROLE_PERMISSIONS`` enforces. Renaming a role there leaves the mapping
    pointing at a string that grants nothing, which reads in a console as
    though it grants something. Checked in both directions, so a *new* role
    must also be classified as assignable or recorded as deliberately not.

*mounting*
    A router nobody includes serves nothing. ``include_router`` does not
    populate ``app.routes`` on the pinned FastAPI, so an inventory assertion
    can measure nothing and pass; this reads the call itself out of
    ``main.py``, and ``test_scim_provisioning.py`` proves reachability by
    sending real requests.
