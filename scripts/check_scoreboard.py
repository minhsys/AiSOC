"""Gate the public benchmark scoreboard against a real live-agent run (Phase E1).

This closes the last `NO GATE` row in the claim-to-gate matrix — "the weekly
benchmark scoreboard runs live against main". Before this, `apps/docs/static/
data/scoreboard.json` was hand-maintained and the only automation
(`wet-eval.yml`) no-ops without a funded LLM key, so nothing in per-PR CI proved
the published headline number matched what the agent actually scores.

This checker makes the scoreboard **backed by a failing test**:

1. **Schema** — validates the scoreboard against `scoreboard.schema.json`.
2. **Honesty invariants** — every row carries `substrate` (bool) + `eval_mode`;
   `substrate:true` rows must use a substrate `eval_mode` and are never allowed
   to omit the marker (so a deterministic number can't be quoted as live-LLM).
3. **Freshness** — runs the deterministic live-agent MITRE-accuracy eval (the
   real LangGraph tactic prediction over the 200-incident corpus, no LLM key
   required) and asserts the newest `substrate:true` row's `mitre_accuracy`
   matches the freshly-computed value within tolerance. If the agent's accuracy
   changes and the scoreboard isn't refreshed, CI fails.

The LLM-tier (`substrate:false`) rows remain the province of the weekly funded
`wet-eval.yml` job; this gate governs the per-PR deterministic tier + the
scoreboard's structural + honesty contract.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_scoreboard.py --check      # CI gate (default)
    python3 scripts/check_scoreboard.py --refresh     # rewrite the newest
                                                       # substrate row in place
