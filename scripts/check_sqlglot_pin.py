"""Assert every install path declares the same sqlglot version range.

sqlglot is not an ordinary dependency. It is the component that enforces
tenant isolation on the ClickHouse lake: `services/api/app/services/lake_sql.py`
parses untrusted operator SQL with it, checks the table allowlist against the
parse tree, bans ClickHouse table functions, and injects the mandatory
`tenant_id` predicate into every relation. If two builds of the same commit
resolve different sqlglot versions, they have different isolation guarantees.

That is not hypothetical. `services/api/pyproject.toml` declared `<31.0.0`
while the Dockerfile and every CI workflow declared `<27`. sqlglot moved the
SELECT's FROM clause from `args["from"]` to `args["from_"]` in 27, so on the
versions only pyproject allowed, the rewriter's table walk found nothing,
concluded the query was a constant projection, and returned it untouched —
no allowlist check, no table-function ban, and no tenant predicate — while
reporting success. The unit tests would have caught it; they never ran on a
version pyproject permitted, because CI installed the narrow range.

So the property this gate enforces is *agreement*, not any particular bound.
Widening the supported range is fine; widening it in one place is not.

# `lake-isolation.yml` installs sqlglot from a build matrix, deliberately

#
#   `shipped`       must equal the agreed pin, or the matrix proves a version
#                   nothing installs still works.
#   `forward-compat` must carry no upper bound, and must not float below the
#                   shipped floor.

# The second rule is the one with history behind it. That leg used to read
# `>=27,<31`, which only reached past the pin while the pin sat below 27.
# With the pin on the 30 line there is no sqlglot 31 to name, so the leg is
# written unbounded and resolves whatever is newest: it re-runs the shipped
# version today and arms itself the day a higher major is published, with no
# edit and nobody remembering. A ceiling would take that away silently, which
