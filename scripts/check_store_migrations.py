"""Gate: every store with schema has a migration runner, and it is called.

Three stores hold schema that code depends on — Neo4j, ClickHouse and
Qdrant — and none had a way to change it. `clickhouse/001_init.sql` is four
`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements and zero `ALTER TABLE`;
`lake_writer` self-heals with the same idiom; `QdrantStore.initialize()`
creates collections if absent. All three are no-ops once the object exists,
so a schema change lands on a fresh deployment and silently does not land on
an existing one. Nothing notices until a query selects a column that is not
there, long after the deploy that was meant to add it.

The second half of this gate matters more than the first. v8.0 spent a
release discovering that **the mechanism existed, was unit-tested, and had
no caller on the path that needed it** — so a runner that exists and is
never invoked is not progress, it is the same defect with better test
coverage. This checks both.

Parsed rather than imported: the API package pulls in SQLAlchemy, asyncpg,
Neo4j and ClickHouse drivers, and a structural gate that needs a database
container is a gate that gets disabled.
