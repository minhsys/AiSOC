"""Every test file in a tree must be reached by that tree's own CI invocation.

Why this exists
---------------
``services/agents`` ships 82 test files. Until this gate landed, the workflow
step that runs them named 26 of those files one per line, and the other 56
were executed by nothing at all. Not skipped, not quarantined, not xfailed —
uncollected, which prints nothing and looks exactly like a suite that passed.

``test_playbook_engine_correctness.py`` was one of the 56. It carried a test
that spent fourteen seconds doing the precise thing its own name said must not
happen, and it did so for as long as it existed, because nothing ever ran it
to notice.

A hand-maintained list of files is the same mechanism as the hand-written
``ConnectorType`` union whose ten members named nothing the platform ingests,
and the hand-kept alias vocabulary that let an authenticated route read as
wide open. In each case the list was correct when written and the tree moved.
The fix is the same in all three: stop maintaining the list, derive it.

The question this asks
----------------------
Not "do the tests pass" — that is the suite's job. This asks **which test
files the tree's own invocation can even reach**, and it asks it in both
directions:

``unreached``
    A test file exists in a tree and no invocation for that tree collects it.
    Adding a file to a directory CI already runs is free; adding one beside a
    hand-maintained list is silently free of signal.

``names-nothing``
    An invocation names a path that is not there. A step that lists a deleted
    file either fails loudly on every run or, more often, the list was updated
    and the file was not — either way the step no longer does what it reads
    as doing.

What counts as reached
----------------------
pytest's own collection rules, applied to the arguments CI actually passes:
a directory argument reaches every ``test_*.py`` / ``*_test.py`` beneath it
(minus ``--ignore``), a file argument reaches that file, and
``--ignore``/``--deselect`` subtract. Anything a ``conftest.py`` adds to
``collect_ignore`` is subtracted too, because a file pytest is told to skip
collecting is not reached however it is named.

Quarantine is the one honest way to not run a file, and it has to be visible:
a file listed in ``QUARANTINE`` below is excused from ``unreached`` and must
carry a stated reason. The list is checked in both directions, so an entry
naming a file that no longer exists — or one that has since become reachable
— fails the build rather than sitting there looking like coverage.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/check_test_discovery.py              # gate
    python3 scripts/check_test_discovery.py --list       # per-tree detail
    python3 scripts/check_test_discovery.py --json
    python3 scripts/check_test_discovery.py --self-test  # prove it detects drift

Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings, 2 the scan itself could not run.
