"""Two claims that decay quietly: a sanitiser's allowlist, and a meter's honesty.

Why an allowlist needs a gate
------------------------------
`ALLOWED_ELEMENTS` in the SVG sanitiser is one line away from being useless.
The pressure on it is real and sympathetic: an operator's logo does not render
the way it did in their graphics program, somebody traces it to a dropped
element, and the smallest change that fixes the complaint is to add that
element to the list. If the element is `foreignObject`, `use`, `style` or
`script`, the sanitiser is now a function that returns its input.

The unit tests cover the payloads somebody thought of. This covers the
*shape*: no element or attribute that can execute, fetch or reference another
document may enter the allowlist, whatever the reason.

Why a meter needs a gate
-------------------------
Two of this repository's console figures were wrong on real data while their
tests passed, because each test compared a producer against a copy of itself.
The metering tests avoid that by counting rows independently. What they cannot
see is a *new* meter added later with the tenant formatted into its SQL, or a
meter that quietly starts doing arithmetic on a price.

So this reads the declarations:

* every meter binds the tenant as a parameter and never formats one in;
* no meter carries pricing vocabulary, because 13.3 says metering and the
  commercial question belongs elsewhere;
* a meter that cannot be measured on this deployment is named with a reason
  and is *not* also declared as a meter, so it can never be reported as zero.
