"""No commit that lands on a protected branch may go ungraded.

Why this exists
---------------
A required status check is a promise that every commit reaching the branch was
graded. `ci.yml` broke that promise quietly for months: its concurrency group
was keyed on `github.ref`, which is the same string for every push to `main`,
with `cancel-in-progress: true`. During a merge burst each merge killed the
previous merge's run mid-`Python — Tests`.

Measured on this repository before the fix, over the last 1,000 push-triggered
runs on `main`: 259 ended `cancelled`. `ci.yml` alone was 36 cancelled out of
51. Over the last 30 commits on `main`, only 336 of the 660 required-check x
commit pairs actually graded — 51%.

None of that looked like a problem, and that is the point:

* A cancelled run reports `cancelled`, not `failure`. Nothing turns red.
* Worse, a job whose `needs:` dependency was cancelled never starts, so it
  never produces a check run at all. The eight `python-services-wave-2-test`
  matrix checks did not report on 15 of 30 commits for exactly that reason:
  their `needs: python-lint` was killed first. A check that is *absent* is
  even less visible than one that is cancelled.
* `main` reads green on whatever HEAD happens to be, because HEAD is the one
  commit nothing superseded.

What this gate asserts
----------------------
For every workflow that can be triggered by a push to a protected branch, the
concurrency configuration must not be able to discard that push's run. Two
independent ways it can, and both are checked:

`cancel-in-progress`
    The obvious one. Truthy for a push event means the next push kills this
    run mid-flight.

a concurrency group shared across commits
    The non-obvious one, and the reason `cancel-in-progress: false` is not a
    fix on its own. GitHub's documented behaviour is that when a run queues
    into a busy group, *any run already pending in that group is cancelled*.
    So a non-cancelling group still loses every intermediate run on a burst —
    it only guarantees the first and the last.

    This is not theoretical either. `publish-images.yml` was moved to
    `cancel-in-progress: false` after a release left twelve images current and
    the thirteenth two commits behind. On the day this gate was written that
    workflow still had 13 runs on `main` ending `cancelled`, each with **zero
    jobs** — cancelled while pending, before a single step existed.

The fix in both cases is the same: key the group so a push never shares one.
A pull request still supersedes its own earlier runs, because only a branch's
head commit needs grading:

    group: <prefix>-${{ github.event_name }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.sha }}
    cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}

Bidirectional by construction
-----------------------------
The recurring failure in this repository is the one-directional check: it
compares A against B and never B against A, so drift in the direction things
actually change slips past while the check prints OK. An exception list keyed
only on "is this workflow allowed?" has that shape — the entry outlives the
reason and is there to launder the next regression.

So every exception records the reason, and both directions are errors:

    tree -> exceptions   a workflow that can drop a push run with no entry.
    exceptions -> tree   an entry whose workflow is gone, or which no longer
                         has the shape it excuses.

Non-vacuity
-----------
A gate that can pass while inspecting nothing is worse than no gate. Three
guards, all printed:

* the root comes from `git rev-parse` via `gate_toolkit.repo_root`, never from
  this file's location, and is verified against sentinel paths;
* the walk must reach a plausible number of workflows, and must still find
  push-triggered workflows that declare a concurrency group — a scan that
  matches none means the parse broke, not that the tree is clean;
* `--self-test` runs the detector over known-bad and known-good workflow
  documents and asserts it separates them, and asserts the comparison itself
  rejects an empty scan.
