"""Fetch MITRE Engenuity ATT&CK Evaluations results for the fidelity benchmark.

Usage:
    python scripts/datasets/download_mitre_engenuity.py --accept-license
                                                        [--round enterprise-2024]
                                                        [--out datasets/mitre-engenuity]

Why this exists: `mitre_engenuity_loader.py` has been able to parse the
full Round-7 procedure JSON since it landed, and there was no way to
obtain it — CICIDS-2017 and CTU-13 each shipped a downloader and this did
not. So the published fidelity number for this dataset came from a
committed micro fixture, which proves the loader parses and says nothing
about the classifier at scale.

Unlike the other three, this is not a single archive: Engenuity publishes
per-round, per-vendor result JSON through a public API. What it fetches
is the **procedure and detection-category data**, which is what the
loader reads — not the vendor rankings, which Engenuity explicitly asks
not be used for comparison and which this benchmark has no business
republishing.
