"""Create `.env` and fill its generated secrets with real values.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
``README.md`` documents three commands: ``git clone``, ``cp .env.example .env``,
``make up``. The middle one used to break the deployment.

``.env.example`` shipped
``AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY=replace-me-with-a-freshly-generated-fernet-key``.
``docker-compose.yml`` interpolates that straight into the API container, and
``app.security.credential_vault`` takes its friendly ephemeral-development-key
path only when the key is **empty** — a non-empty invalid key reaches
``Fernet()`` and raises, which the connector endpoints turn into HTTP 500
``credential vault unavailable``. Nothing failed at boot, so the operator met
the failure minutes later at the connector wizard, with no line connecting it
back to the ``cp``. Skipping the documented ``cp`` produced a *working* vault
and following the README produced a broken one.

The fix chosen, and why
-----------------------
Generate real values at setup time rather than teaching the vault to tolerate a
placeholder. Tolerating it would mean a deployment whose connector credentials
silently do not survive a restart — a worse failure than the loud one, because
it is invisible until a customer's saved credential stops decrypting. The
placeholder is a *setup* defect and setup is where it is fixed.

Two layers, because either alone still leaves a hole:

1. This script, run by ``make up`` / ``make env`` / ``install.sh``, writes a
   freshly generated value for each secret below whenever the current one is
   empty or a placeholder. The documented quick start therefore ends with a
   vault that works *and* persists.
2. ``.env.example`` now ships these three **empty** rather than as prose. An
   operator who hand-copies the template and never runs the generator gets the
   documented development path (an ephemeral key, logged as a warning) instead
   of a hard 500. Empty is a value the vault already understands; the
   placeholder was not.

Secrets are written, never printed: the output says which names were filled.
