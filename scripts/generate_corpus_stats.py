"""Generate the single source of truth for AiSOC's detection / marketplace counts.

Why this exists
---------------
``generate_connector_count.py`` already proved the shape: derive the number
from the tree, commit the artefact, gate the artefact. Every *other* corpus
figure on the landing page was still hand-typed, and every one of them had
drifted:

  * ``Hero.tsx``               "6,998 detections ... 57 plugins"
  * ``ConnectorsMarquee.tsx``  "6,998 detections"
  * ``FeatureGrid.tsx``        "6,998 YAML rules", "7,117 community items"
  * ``Pillars.tsx``            stat "6,998" / "public detection rules"
  * ``ContributorLeaderboard.tsx``  "218 rules across 5 categories"

Three different wrong answers to one question, and no gate covering any of
them. Worse than stale: "6,998 detections" counts the imported corpus, ~85% of
which sits under ``detections/*/\\_quarantine/`` and is never loaded. Quoting it
as the detection capability presents quarantined rules as executable, which
this repository has a standing rule against.

So the artefact separates the two figures rather than picking one:

``executable``
    What the engine loads — ``services/fusion/app/data/detection_ruleset.json``
    plus ``detection_ruleset_imported.json`` beside it. This is the capability
    number and the one the UI leads with.
``on_disk`` / ``quarantined``
    The corpus as indexed by ``marketplace/index.json``. Real, published, and
    only ever quoted *as* a corpus.

Cross-checking, in both directions
----------------------------------
The recurring defect in this tree's gates is the one-directional comparison:
it checks A against B, never B against A, so drift in the direction things
actually change slips through while the gate prints OK. Three independent
places count detections here — the compiled engine ruleset, the generated
truth table, and the marketplace index — so this reconciles all three against
each other before writing anything. A disagreement is a hard error, not a
silently-preferred source.

Outputs
-------
  * ``apps/web/src/data/corpus-stats.json``  — machine-readable payload.
  * ``apps/web/src/data/corpusStats.ts``     — TypeScript constants imported by
    every landing / marketplace / detections surface.

Usage
-----

    python3 scripts/generate_corpus_stats.py             # write outputs
    python3 scripts/generate_corpus_stats.py --check     # fail if drift
    python3 scripts/generate_corpus_stats.py --self-test # prove the gate works
