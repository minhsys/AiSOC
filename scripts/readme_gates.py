"""Quick-win on-ramp CI gates for the AiSOC GitHub front door.

This script bundles every assertion the v0 onramp plan promised would gate
PRs that touch the README front door:

1. README line count ≤ 250 (the README diet target).
2. Every npm / PyPI package referenced in README either resolves on the
   registry today, or is paired with a `Coming … in v8.0` guard so users
   are not directed to a 404.
3. Every reference to `apps/web/public/demo/<asset>` in README is paired
   with an actually-existing file (or is paired with an explicit
   "rendered .mp4 lands with v8.0" guard).

The four-th gate (`aisoc-sandbox` cross-platform smoke test) lives in a
separate matrix job in `.github/workflows/readme-gates.yml` because it
needs Linux + macOS runners.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/readme_gates.py
        # exit 0 on pass, non-zero on first failure.

    python3 scripts/readme_gates.py --no-network
        # skip the npm / PyPI registry probe; useful for offline / sandboxed
        # CI runners that block egress to the public registries.

# text must use the current one — a README shipped *as* vX cannot coherently
# promise that something lands in vX.

# v9.0 stops moving the number. The README no longer says packaging "comes
# in" any version, because a README shipped *as* v9.0 promising v9.0 is the
# incoherence this list was created to police, and promising v9.1 would just
# be the fourth slip. It says what is true instead: the pipeline builds and
# packs all eight packages on every tag, and the upload is blocked on
# registry credentials — which is an account action and cannot be scheduled.

# — the README advertised 947 executable rules while the truth table said 833,
# and 62 GATED while the matrix said 72. Neither is a typo class of error: a
# reader has no way to tell the front page from the generated artifact, so the
# larger number is simply believed. This gate makes the README unable to quote a

#: `ROADMAP.md` was the omission that proved the point. Its tally line even
#: instructs the reader to recount with the script "rather than trusting a
