"""Keep every copy of ``app/core/kafka_security.py`` byte-identical.

Seven Python services construct Kafka clients, and each is built with its own
directory as the Docker build context — the same reason ``cors.py`` and
``tenant_scope.py`` are vendored rather than imported.

Drift is the hazard this prevents, and for a transport resolver it is a
particularly quiet one: a service whose copy still allows cleartext in
production does not fail, it connects, and the only symptom is that one
consumer out of seven is speaking plaintext to a broker the other six reach
over TLS. Nobody reads seven files side by side to find that.

Run modes
---------
* ``python scripts/sync_vendored_kafka_security.py``         — copy source → vendored.
* ``python scripts/sync_vendored_kafka_security.py --check`` — fail if any copy
  is missing or differs. CI uses this mode.

Dependency-free so it runs in any CI runner.
