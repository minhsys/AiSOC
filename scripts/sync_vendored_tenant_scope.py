"""Keep every copy of ``app/security/tenant_scope.py`` in lockstep.

The tenant-scope resolver is the thing that decides which tenant a request may
read. It is vendored into each service that needs it rather than imported,
because every service is built with its own directory as the Docker build
context — the same reason ``service_auth.py`` and ``cors.py`` are vendored.

That makes drift the hazard. A fix to the verifier that lands in one copy and
not the others leaves the un-fixed services accepting what the fixed one
rejects, and the difference is invisible until somebody reads all six files
side by side. So the copies are byte-identical apart from one line:
``SERVICE_NAME``, which selects the per-service token override.

Run modes
---------
* ``python scripts/sync_vendored_tenant_scope.py``         — copy source → vendored.
* ``python scripts/sync_vendored_tenant_scope.py --check`` — fail (exit 1) if any
  copy is missing or differs. CI uses this mode.

The script is dependency-free so it runs in any CI runner.
