"""Expose the closed-finding readers so replay evaluation can reach them.

Gap-closure Phase 1.4.

Phase 1.1 put five readers on the five SIEM clients in this service, because
this service already owns the credential path. Nothing called them. This is
the route that does.

Why the route is here and not in ``services/api``
-------------------------------------------------
The API orchestrates the replay job, but it cannot read a customer's SIEM
itself without a second copy of every client. ``services/actions`` holds the
clients, the retry behaviour, the pagination loops and the vendor quirks that
Phase 1.1 recorded one at a time. A reader in the API would be a sixth place
for "what does a closed Splunk notable look like" to be written down.

So the API decrypts ``auth_config`` from the vault and forwards it, exactly
the trust model ``POST /connectors/{id}/normalize`` already uses from Phase
1.2. Nothing is persisted here and no credential is stored: the client is
built, used for one window, and dropped.

Why the client factory is imported rather than rewritten
--------------------------------------------------------
``app.executors.siem`` already builds all five clients from a flat credential
mapping, and this repository has twice found a second factory reading keys the
first one does not. ``_splunk_client`` and friends are reused as-is, so a
credential key that works for writeback works for the read in the same
deployment. The one client ``siem.py`` builds inline rather than through a
factory is Defender, and that arm is built here from the same
``DEFENDER_CLIENT_PARAM_KEYS`` it declares.

What a vendor with no usable credentials gets
---------------------------------------------
A 422 naming the keys that would have built a client, not an empty list. An
empty list reads as "this customer closed nothing in that window", which is a
statement about their SOC rather than about their configuration, and it would
travel into a report as a sample size of zero.
