"""
Microsoft Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) client.

Wraps the Microsoft Graph API surfaces AiSOC needs for the
identity-response action verbs:

* ``disable_user``    — set ``accountEnabled = false`` on the user.
* ``enable_user``     — undoes the above; used by the rollback path.
* ``revoke_sessions`` — invoke ``revokeSignInSessions`` so all
                        existing refresh tokens are invalidated and
                        the user is forced to re-authenticate
                        (effectively a session "suspend").
* ``reset_password``  — emit a temporary password the user is forced
                        to change at next sign-in. We deliberately
                        do not surface that password back to the
                        caller; the IdP delivers it via the OOB
                        channel a tenant has configured (usually
                        SMS or email).
* ``require_mfa``     — toggle the per-user MFA state via the
                        beta endpoint (Entra's general-availability
                        replacement, ``authenticationStrengthPolicy``,
                        is a CA-level construct that AiSOC can't
                        own from a playbook).

Credentials expected in :class:`ActionRequest.parameters`:

* ``azure_tenant_id``
* ``azure_client_id``
* ``azure_client_secret``

All four verbs accept ``user_id`` as either an objectId or a UPN
(email). Graph resolves both, so we don't pre-translate.

Why client_credentials and not delegated auth: the playbook
context has no human in the loop — we're acting on behalf of a
service principal. The tenant admin must grant the principal at
least ``User.ReadWrite.All`` (for disable/enable + reset),
``UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All`` (for MFA toggle), and
``Directory.AccessAsUser.All`` is NOT needed (and should not be
granted; it would let the principal act as any user).
