"""
Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS XML API client.

Wraps the subset of the PAN-OS XML API the AiSOC action layer needs:
add / remove an IP address to a dynamic address group via "register"
and "unregister" tag updates, and commit the candidate config when
the caller asks for it.

Why dynamic address groups (DAGs) instead of editing static address
objects: every reasonable PAN-OS deployment uses DAGs for
SOC-driven blocks because (a) tagged-IP changes don't require a
commit on PA-3000 / PA-5000 series boxes (they take effect inside
seconds via the user-id agent / runtime engine), (b) they round-trip
cleanly through Panorama, and (c) tagging is idempotent so AiSOC
can retry without leaving stale entries.

Credentials expected in ``ActionRequest.parameters``:

* ``panos_host``    — firewall management IP / FQDN.
* ``panos_api_key`` — generated via ``/api/?type=keygen&user=...``.
* ``panos_tag``     — tag the firewall's DAG is matched against
                      (e.g. ``aisoc-blocked``). The DAG itself
                      must already exist; AiSOC never creates it
                      because security teams own the policy layer.
* ``panos_vsys``    — vsys identifier, default ``vsys1``.

The client does not own a long-lived ``httpx.AsyncClient`` because
the PAN-OS XML API has session-bound caching surprises that bite
when the same connection straddles a commit; opening a new
connection per call is cheap (the firewall is on a low-latency
management network) and avoids those.
