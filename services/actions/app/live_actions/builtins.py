"""
Builtin :class:`LiveActionExecutor` adapters for in-tree executors.

The existing ``services/actions/app/executors/*`` modules expose
vendor-aware executors keyed by ``ActionType``. They auto-select a
vendor at call time based on which credentials appear in
``ActionRequest.parameters`` (e.g. ``cs_client_id`` => CrowdStrike,
``mde_tenant_id`` => Microsoft Defender). That dispatch model worked
for the ActionType-based registry but it doesn't expose a clean
``(vendor_id, capability)`` mapping that the agent layer wants.

This module wraps each (vendor, capability) pair as its own
:class:`LiveActionExecutor`, so the live-action registry can answer
"who can isolate a host?" with a specific list of vendors instead
of one fuzzy "isolate_host" entry that may or may not have credentials.

Why adapters instead of porting the executors:
  The legacy executors are exercised by a substantial test suite
  (``services/actions/tests/``) and called from the Action Execution
  REST API. Rewriting them carries regression risk for zero functional
  benefit at this stage. The adapter layer is a thin bridge: it
  constructs the legacy ``ActionRequest``, calls the legacy executor,
  and translates the result into a :class:`LiveActionResult`.

Naming convention for ``vendor_id``:
  We use the matching ``connector_id`` from ``services/connectors``
  whenever one exists (``crowdstrike``, ``defender``, ``okta``,
  ``aws_security_groups``, ``splunk``, ``elastic``, ``slack``,
  ``jira``, ``servicenow``). For built-in actions that don't map to
  a single connector (e.g. the generic ``block_domain`` simulation),
  we use a descriptive vendor like ``"generic"`` so the agent loop
  has *some* vendor to plan against rather than failing the lookup.
