"""Contract per capability, not per vendor.

What an action does to an estate is a property of the verb. Isolating a host
is equally disruptive on CrowdStrike, Defender and SentinelOne, so declaring
it three times invites the three to drift — and the one that drifts low is
the one that auto-executes.

Adding a vendor for an existing verb therefore inherits the classification
automatically. Adding a *new verb* requires an entry here, which the
conformance gate enforces, so a capability cannot reach dispatch without
somebody having decided what it does when the finding is wrong.

The classifications below are deliberately conservative. The cost of an
unnecessary approval is a few minutes of analyst time. The cost of a wrong
autonomous containment is an outage plus the organisational trust needed to
ever enable autonomy again, and that second one does not come back.

#: Legacy ``ActionType`` value -> capability name, for the cases where the
#: two vocabularies chose different words for the same verb.
#:
#: Only one entry, and it is a naming gap rather than a missing capability:
#: the public API verb is ``notify_slack`` (it predates the capability
#: registry and names the transport), the capability is ``notify`` (it names
#: the verb, which is the whole point of a per-capability contract), and
#: ``SlackNotify`` in ``builtins.py`` already bridges them. What was missing
#: was anything that told a *lookup by ActionType value* about the bridge, so
#: ``approval_gate`` found no contract, skipped the confidence matrix
#: entirely and let blast radius decide alone.
#:
#: Why an alias and not a rename. ``action_type`` is persisted as free text:
#: ``remediation_whitelist`` (migration 015) stores operator pre-approvals
#: keyed ``UNIQUE (tenant_id, action_type)``, so renaming the enum member
#: silently orphans every row an operator created for ``notify_slack`` —
#: their pre-approval stops matching and nobody is told. It is also a
#: documented request field (``{"action_type": "notify_slack"}`` in
#: ``apps/docs/docs/operations/notifications.md``) and a member of the
#: ``ActionType`` union in ``packages/types``.
#:
#: When to delete this. It retires with ``ActionType`` itself: the enum is
#: already the legacy half of the registry (every adapter carries a
#: ``_legacy_action_type`` pointing back at it) and the live-actions path
#: dispatches on capability strings. When the ``POST /actions`` body takes a
#: capability and the ``remediation_whitelist`` rows have been migrated,
#: this map and the enum go together. Until then a new entry here needs the
#: same justification: a *naming* difference for a verb that already has a
#: contract, never a stand-in for a capability nobody wrote.
