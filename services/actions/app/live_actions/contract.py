"""The action contract: what every response action must declare about itself.

Pillar 3. An action registry is only as good as what it can tell you *before*
it runs. Today an executor declares four things — vendor, capability, whether
it needs credentials, and a description — and everything that actually
governs execution is inferred elsewhere or not at all:

* risk is inferred from the capability name in one place and from a policy
  table in another, and the two can disagree
* reversibility is not declared, so the rollback path has a hardcoded list of
  four actions and nothing tells you whether a fifth is reversible
* verification is not declared, so an action reports success on an HTTP 200
  and nobody knows whether a probe exists to check the effect landed
* nothing distinguishes "needs approval" from "no tier may ever auto-execute
  this"

This module makes all of it declarative, and
``scripts/check_action_contract.py`` makes it enforced. The point is not
tidiness: the gap between "the API returned 200" and "the host is actually
contained" is how a SOC comes to believe it responded when it did not.

Adding a field here is a breaking change for every executor, which is
deliberate. An action that cannot say what it does to a production estate
should not be dispatchable.
