"""
Dispatch live-action requests to registered executors.

The dispatcher is the single entry point used by the REST router and by
internal callers (agent loop, playbook engine). It enforces these invariants
so individual executors never have to think about them:

  1. **Unknown (vendor, capability) returns FAILED, not 500.** Callers
     get a structured :class:`LiveActionResult` so the agent loop can
     decide whether to fall back to a different vendor.
  2. **Executor exceptions are caught and converted to FAILED.** A
     buggy plugin must never crash the actions service.
  3. **Structured logs include request_id, vendor, capability, dry_run
     and outcome.** This is what feeds the audit trail and the cost
     dashboard.
  4. **Phase B2 — the autonomy-safety policy governs every real execution.**
     Any request whose capability maps to an :class:`ActionType` runs through
     ``autonomy_safety.decide()`` before the executor is invoked (this closes
     the Phase 9b wiring gap). Copilot is the default: below-tier actions are
     downgraded to a dry-run preview, HIGH/CRITICAL blast queues for a human,
     and tier L0 blocks outright. The gate never *upgrades* a request — an
     explicit ``dry_run=True`` stays a dry-run whatever the tier says.
  5. **Phase B2 — connector-style credentials are translated at the boundary.**
     A request carrying ``auth_config`` (connector schema field names) has it
     resolved into the executor's vendor-prefixed params via
     ``credential_resolver.resolve_params`` — so configured connector
     credentials actually reach the executor instead of falling back to
     simulation mode.
