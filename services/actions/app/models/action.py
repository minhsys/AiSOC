    # `add_ioc_to_blocklist` and `run_playbook` were here and had no executor
    # behind either of them, so the API accepted both and answered "No
    # executor found for action type" — which reads as a broken deployment
    # rather than a verb nobody built. Neither was a missing implementation:
    #
    #   add_ioc_to_blocklist  a second name for `block_ioc`, which has a
    #                         Defender arm, a contract, an adapter and a place
    #                         in the vocabulary. Two names for one verb means
    #                         half the callers reach the dead one.
    #   run_playbook          playbook execution lives in services/agents and
    #                         always has. It is also the wrong shape for this
    #                         registry: the contract belongs to the verb, and
    #                         "run an arbitrary bundle of verbs" has no
    #                         verb-level impact, reversal or probe. Approving
    #                         it once would execute whatever steps it contains
    #                         without each one meeting its own contract, which
    #                         is precisely what the per-capability contract
    #                         exists to prevent. Playbooks dispatch step by
    #                         step through this service instead, so every step
    #                         is graded on the way past — via
    #                         `services/agents/app/playbook/action_bridge.py`
    #                         and `POST /api/v1/playbook-steps/dispatch`.
    #
    #                         That last sentence was not true when it was
    #                         written. `_handle_block_ip` and
    #                         `_handle_isolate_host` returned
    #                         `{"simulated": True}` from inside the engine and
    #                         reached no executor, and twelve further step
    #                         types had no handler at all. The bridge named
    #                         above is what made it true; the named modules
    #                         are here so the claim can be checked rather than
    #                         taken on trust.
