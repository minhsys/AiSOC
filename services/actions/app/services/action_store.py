"""Where a pending action lives between submission and approval.

It lived in a module-global dict:

    # In-memory action store (replace with DB in production)
    _actions: dict[str, dict[str, Any]] = {}

Which means a restart lost every action awaiting approval, and a second
replica could not see the first one's. Both matter more here than for most
caches, because the thing being lost is a *pending containment*: an analyst
receives a Slack card, the pod is rescheduled, and the approve button returns
"Action not found" for an incident that is still live. There is no retry for
that — the agent already decided, and the record of what it wanted is gone.

Postgres when a DSN is configured, the in-memory dict when not. The fallback
is not a compromise: the unit suite has no database, and a store that cannot
run without one would push every test onto a mock of itself.

Writes are upserts on the action id, so a replay of the same submission is
idempotent rather than a duplicate pending approval.
