"""The gate that actually runs on ``POST /actions``, combining both axes.

``BlastRadiusGate`` asks one question: is this verb's blast radius within the
auto-execute limit. That is a property of the verb alone, so the same answer
comes back for a 40%-confidence guess and a corroborated finding.

``approval_matrix.evaluate`` asks the other one — confidence against the
action's declared impact, under the tenant's autonomy tier — and it was
written, documented, unit-tested, listed in the claim-to-gate matrix as
GATED, and **called by nothing**. A repository-wide search for
``approval_matrix`` found the module, its own test, the contract checker and
two doc mentions. The gate the docs described was not the gate that ran.

This module runs both and takes the stricter, which is the composition rule
the matrix already states for its own three inputs: each can raise a
requirement, none can lower it. So switching it on cannot make anything
auto-execute that did not before.

Every ``ActionType`` member now resolves to a capability contract, and
``scripts/check_action_contract.py`` fails if one stops doing so.

The last hold-out was ``notify_slack``. It was never a missing capability:
the verb is ``notify``, it has a contract, and ``SlackNotify`` already
bridged the two. What was missing was anything connecting a lookup *by
ActionType value* to that bridge, so this gate found no contract, skipped
the confidence matrix and let blast radius decide alone — a 40%-confidence
guess and a corroborated finding got the same answer for the one verb most
likely to be auto-executed. ``contract_for_action_type`` closes it by alias
rather than by rename, because ``action_type`` is persisted operator intent
(see the note on ``ACTION_TYPE_CAPABILITY_ALIASES``).

An unmapped verb is still possible in principle, and is still recorded at
debug rather than guessed at: inventing an impact for a verb nobody declared
is how a gate starts certifying things it never examined.

A request with no ``confidence`` is treated as the lowest band. For anything
above READ_ONLY impact that means analyst approval, which is a real tightening
of the previous behaviour and is the intended direction.
