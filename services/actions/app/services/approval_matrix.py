"""Approval as a function of confidence *and* impact, not autonomy tier alone.

The L0–L4 ladder answers "how much is this tenant willing to automate". It
does not answer "is this particular action safe at this particular
confidence", and treating one as the other produces both failure modes:
enriching an IOC blocked behind an approval queue because the tier is low,
and isolating a production database server auto-executed because the tier is
high and the model said 94%.

The matrix is the second axis. Every decision needs both:

    enrich an IOC              any confidence    automatic
    search endpoints           any confidence    automatic
    block a known-bad hash     >= 99%            automatic
    kill a process             >= 98%            policy (tier decides)
    disable an account         >= 99%            analyst approval
    isolate a production host  any confidence    mandatory human
    delete a cloud resource    any confidence    prohibited

Two properties are non-negotiable and are asserted in tests:

**The matrix can only raise a requirement, never lower it.** If either the
action's declared contract or the confidence threshold says a human is
needed, a human is needed. An autonomy tier of L4 does not override an
action declared MANDATORY_HUMAN, and high confidence does not override an
IRREVERSIBLE impact.

**Missing confidence is not high confidence.** An action arriving with no
confidence score is treated as the lowest band. The alternative — defaulting
to permissive — means a scoring bug becomes an autonomous action.

#: Observe: all actions routed to approval queue. L1 — Notify: MINIMAL
#: blast-radius actions are automatic", and ``_AUTO_ALLOWED_AT_TIER`` encodes
#: it as ``set()`` for L0 and ``{MINIMAL}`` for L1. READ_ONLY impact is the
#: same thing as MINIMAL blast radius — ``dispatcher._IMPACT_BLAST`` maps one
#: onto the other — so L1's entry here is READ_ONLY.
#:
#: It read ``None``, which put a pure read into the analyst queue at the
#: default tier. That is the failure mode this module's own docstring opens
#: by naming, and the contract gate calls a read requiring approval
#: "mis-classified or not actually a read". The registry door had grown a
#: local bypass to route around it; this table entry is where the answer
#: belongs, so there is one of it.
#:
#: Only READ_ONLY moves. Every impact above it ranks higher than the L1
#: ceiling and still returns ANALYST, exactly as the ``None`` branch did.
