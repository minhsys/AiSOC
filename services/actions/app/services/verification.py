"""Post-action verification (Phase B3).

A real SOC doesn't trust "the API returned 200" as proof an action took effect —
it re-queries the vendor. This module adds that read-back step. After an action
executes (and especially when the autonomy decision set
``requires_verification``), :class:`PostActionVerifier.verify` re-queries the
vendor to confirm the effect is actually present and returns a
:class:`VerificationOutcome`:

* ``VERIFIED``   — a real confirming query ran and the effect is present.
* ``FAILED``     — a real query ran and the effect is **absent** (the action
                   silently didn't take, or was undone) — a genuine alarm.
* ``UNVERIFIED`` — no read-back probe exists for this action/vendor yet, so we
                   say so honestly rather than claim success we can't prove.

Verifiers are pluggable async callables keyed by :class:`ActionType`; a probe
receives ``(target, params)`` and returns ``True`` (present) / ``False``
(absent) / ``None`` (couldn't determine). Builtin probes use the same vendor
clients as the forward actions and skip cleanly (→ ``UNVERIFIED``) when
credentials are absent. This keeps the honest default: we never fabricate a
``VERIFIED`` we didn't earn with a real query.
