"""ChatOps verification: a working executor that had nowhere honest to land.

``ChatOpsVerifyExecutor`` has always worked and has always sat in
``EXECUTOR_REGISTRY``, and no live-action adapter reached it — so the only
route to it was the legacy ``ActionType`` endpoint, which has no capability
contract, no approval matrix and no autonomy policy in front of it.

It was left that way deliberately rather than registered, and the reason was
sound: the executor returns ``ActionStatus.RUNNING`` to mean "the prompt went
out and nobody has answered", ``LiveActionStatus`` had no state for that, and
``_to_live_status`` folded everything that was not FAILED or a simulation into
SUCCEEDED. Registering it as-is would have reported an unanswered question as
a completed action.

The fix is the missing state rather than the exemption — and ``AWAITING_COMPLETION``
turned out to be what evidence acquisition needed too, so one status covers
both executors that had no honest result to return.

Why this verb is analyst-gated at ``notify``'s impact: ``notify`` addresses a
SOC channel, this addresses the account under investigation. Sent
automatically on a true positive it tells an attacker they have been detected,
and the verb has no way to know whether the person it is asking is the
suspect.
