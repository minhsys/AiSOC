"""The capability contract must be consulted on the registry-driven path too.

`POST /actions` has run the contract through `approval_gate.apply_matrix`
since the approval gate was fixed. `live_actions.dispatch()` — the path the
agent loop, the console dry-run and now the playbook engine use — ran
`autonomy_safety.decide()` and nothing else. `decide()` reads
`ACTION_BLAST_RADIUS`, a second risk ladder keyed on `ActionType`, and for
nine verbs it is the *weaker* of the two declarations:

    block_ip          blast medium   vs  impact high
    block_domain      blast medium   vs  impact high
    reset_password    blast medium   vs  impact high
    run_script        blast high     vs  impact severe
    quarantine_file   blast low      vs  impact moderate
    ...

So the same verb was graded differently depending on which door it came
through, and the weaker grade belonged to the door an agent uses.

Two further holes these tests pin:

* a capability with a contract and no `ActionType` (`revoke_session`) reached
  its executor with *no* governance at all — `_action_type_for` returned None
  and the whole gate was skipped;
* a tenant `force_auto` override lowered a contract that declares `analyst`,
  which `ActionContract.approval` explicitly forbids ("can raise this but
  never lower it").

Every test here fails against the tree before this change.
