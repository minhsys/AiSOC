"""Verification must run on the live dispatch path, not just in its own test.

The market treats outcome verification as the line between recommending and
responding: proving the target's state actually changed, not that an API call
was accepted. AiSOC had the verifier and did not call it.

`AutonomyDecision.requires_verification` was computed for every auto-executed
action at MEDIUM blast or above and then dropped when the dispatcher assembled
its result. `PostActionVerifier` had no caller anywhere outside
`test_verification.py`, so the product could report that a containment call
succeeded and never that containment took effect.

These tests assert the wiring, which is the part that was missing. They are
deliberately written against `dispatch()` rather than the verifier, because a
passing verifier test is exactly what made this look covered.
