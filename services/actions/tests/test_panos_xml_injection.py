"""GHSA-w754-prh8-m56j: the PAN-OS client must not let a caller write XML.

`_xml_register` and `_xml_unregister` interpolated `ip` and `tag` straight
into a user-id message with f-strings. Both values arrive from
`ActionRequest.parameters`, so a value that closed the `ip` attribute could
append further `<payload>` elements to the same message.

The consequence is worse than it first sounds, and is why this is graded high
rather than medium: the injected payload is *valid* PAN-OS, so calling
`block_ip` produced well-formed XML containing an `unregister` for whatever
address the caller chose. The containment action released a block instead of
applying one, and the firewall reported success.

The fix validates before it escapes. Escaping alone stops the injection and
still hands the firewall a string that is not an address, where it matches
nothing — so a block that never applied would report success, trading a loud
failure for a silent one.
