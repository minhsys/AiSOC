"""The history route: every vendor reachable, every failure named.

Gap-closure Phase 1.4 gate.

Phase 1.1 proved the five readers parse vendor-shaped payloads. This proves
the route in front of them reaches each one, refuses rather than returning an
empty window, and translates the credential mapping the API forwards into a
client that the reader can use.

Every vendor payload here is **synthetic**, hand-built to the shape the
vendor's API documents. None came from a customer.

The assertions that matter are the refusals. An evaluation that turns "your
credentials do not build a client" into an empty list has told an operator
their analysts closed nothing, which is a statement about their SOC rather
than about their configuration.
