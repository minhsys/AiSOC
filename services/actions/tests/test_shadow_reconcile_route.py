"""The route that gives ``shadow_reconcile`` a caller.

Gap-closure Phase 2.1, closing D15.

The module under test existed with eleven tests and no caller. These cover the
route that changes that, and the four answers it has to be able to give: a
window it read and graded, credentials that will never work, a vendor asking us
to slow down, and a vendor that was merely unhappy. Telling the second apart
from the fourth is the whole point, because one of them is worth retrying on a
timer and the other turns into churn nobody reads.
