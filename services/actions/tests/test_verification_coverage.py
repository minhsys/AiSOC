"""A declared verification probe must exist, and must not certify falsely.

The contract marked nine capabilities `has_verification_probe=True` while
three probes were registered. Nothing compared the two, so the declaration
was a claim rather than a fact — and it is precisely the claim the contract
exists to make trustworthy: "this action is checked against the vendor rather
than assumed from an accepted request".

The tests below are mostly about the indeterminate case. A probe that cannot
reach the vendor must say "I do not know", never "yes". Returning True on a
failed lookup is how an uncontained host gets certified as contained, and it
is a one-character mistake.
