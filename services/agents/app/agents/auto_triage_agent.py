"""
Auto-Triage Agent: LLM-based autonomous alert classification.

Uses structured LLM reasoning to classify alerts as true_positive,
benign_true_positive, false_positive, or benign — replacing simple keyword
heuristics with contextual analysis. The taxonomy separates detection validity
from activity maliciousness so a rule that correctly detects authorized
activity (an approved pen-test, a scheduled scan) is a benign_true_positive,
not a false_positive (see ``app.agents.dispositions``). High-confidence
FP / benign / benign_true_positive verdicts are auto-closed; true_positive and
needs_review escalate into the full triage → enrichment → investigation
pipeline.

Metrics are module-level counters. **No route exposes them**: the
``/triage/stats`` endpoint this used to name has never existed in the tree.
They are read in-process and by tests.
