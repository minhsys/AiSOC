Copilot chat API — persistent conversation history.

Endpoints (all under ``/api/v1/copilot``):

    GET  /conversations             — list the last N conversations
    GET  /conversations/{id}        — retrieve a single conversation
    POST /chat                      — one-shot chat (creates / continues conv.)
    POST /chat/stream               — streaming NDJSON variant

Falls back to synthetic deterministic replies when ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` is
unset so the demo path never breaks.
