"""Expose the replay runner so the API can orchestrate an evaluation.

Gap-closure Phase 1.4.

Phase 1.2 built ``app.replay.ReplayRunner``: it drives the production triage
path over a frozen historical window and writes nothing. Nothing called it.
This is the route that does, and it is the second of the two internal routes
the orchestration in ``services/api`` needs.

The tenant comes from the credential
------------------------------------
There is no ``tenant_id`` field on the request. The caller is either a console
session, whose token carries a verified tenant claim, or the API acting as a
trusted service, which declares the tenant it is acting for on
``X-AiSOC-Tenant-ID``. Both resolve through the vendored
``app.security.tenant_scope``, and a service token with no tenant header
resolves to an empty scope that refuses rather than widens.

That matters more here than on a read route. The tenant travels into the
envelope handed to triage, so a caller-supplied tenant would decide which
customer's business-context rules and institutional memory the graded verdict
was produced under.

This route writes nothing either
--------------------------------
The runner constructs the production worker with a
:class:`~app.replay.shadow.ShadowTriageWriter`, and the response carries the
attempted-write counters so the caller can assert on a number rather than on
an absence. Those counters travel into the report's method section.

    Priors are deliberately not derived from the train window's labels here or

    truth.
