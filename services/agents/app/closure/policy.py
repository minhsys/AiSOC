"""Per-tenant, per-class closure policy, and the kill switch.

Parity plan 2.1 and 2.2.

What this replaces
------------------
Closure used a single process-wide threshold,
``AISOC_AUTO_CLOSE_THRESHOLD`` at 0.85, for every tenant and every alert
class. Two other mechanisms existed and governed nothing:

* an earned ``auto_close`` grant was read only by
  ``services/actions/app/services/tenant_policy.py``, which selects
  ``auto_execute`` on **action verbs**, so earning the grant in shadow mode
  changed nothing about closure;
* the console's per-action thresholds were read only by
  ``app.policy.guardrails``, which has no production importer at all.

Shape of the decision
---------------------
Additive, so a deployment that configures nothing behaves exactly as it did:

1. no row for the tenant, or closure not enabled for the class, means the
   process-wide threshold applies as before;
2. a row with a threshold raises or lowers the bar for that class alone;
3. ``require_grant`` additionally demands an earned ``auto_close`` grant, so
   a tenant can say "enabled, but only once shadow mode has earned it";
4. the kill switch, global or per tenant, refuses closure outright.

Order matters. The kill switch is checked **first** and separately from the
policy, because it is the thing somebody reaches for at 3am and it must not
depend on per-class rows being correct.

Failure mode
------------
This reads the database on the alert path, so it must not become a way for
a database blip to start closing alerts that policy would have held. Every
failure here is a **refusal**: an unreadable policy means no auto-close, not
a fallback to the permissive default.
