"""Investigation cost telemetry — what a run spent, and how that is known.

Tracks token usage, model calls, latency, and USD cost per run. Persists
aggregates to PostgreSQL (best-effort) and emits structlog events that feed
the cost dashboard and the SOC metrics dashboard.

Every dollar figure here carries its provenance
-----------------------------------------------
This module used to price a call by looking its **model name** up in a table
of hosted list prices. The name it looked up was an ``aisoc-<role>`` alias,
which is not a model — it is a label the LiteLLM gateway resolves to one. No
alias is in the table, so every call fell through to a ``(0.001, 0.002)``
default: a price nobody charges, for a model nobody named. A 903-token
completion on an operator's own hardware was reported as
``total_cost_usd=0.000999``, and that number reached the cost dashboard, the
per-run ledger, and the budget circuit breaker, which trips at
``AISOC_BUDGET_HARD_USD`` and would have degraded a working local deployment
to deterministic-only over money that was never spent.

A call is now booked under exactly one of three provenances, and the counts
travel with the sums everywhere:

``GATEWAY`` — measured
    The gateway reported the cost on the response headers. It resolved the
    alias, so it is the only party that knows what was actually called. This
    is real money (and is legitimately ``0.0`` for a local model, which is a
    *measured* zero, not an absent one).

``LIST_PRICE_ESTIMATE`` — estimated, and labelled as such on every surface
    No gateway figure, but the concrete model is one this table has a public
    list price for. Only ever keyed on a **concrete** model id — the alias, or
    the resolved model name the gateway supplied — never on an alias alone.

``UNPRICED`` — not measured
    Neither of the above. Reported as *not measured*, never as zero. Following
    the precedent set for MTTR (``services/api/app/api/v1/endpoints/metrics.py``),
    where a mean over zero rows was shipping as a confident ``0.0`` until the
    sample count travelled with it.

There is deliberately no "total cost" that mixes measured with estimated
money: a single number cannot be labelled two ways, and un-labelling an
estimate by adding it to a measurement is the defect one level up.
