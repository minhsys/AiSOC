"""What the call actually cost, according to the thing that placed it.

The defect this replaces
------------------------
``CostTracker`` priced a call by looking its **model name** up in a table of
hosted list prices. The name it looked up was an ``aisoc-<role>`` alias, which
is not a model — it is a label the gateway resolves to one. No alias appears in
the price table, so every call fell through to a ``(0.001, 0.002)`` default and
was booked at a price nobody charges for a model nobody named.

On a local deployment that is not an approximation, it is an invention. A
903-token completion on the operator's own hardware was reported as
``total_cost_usd=0.000999``, and the same figure flowed into the cost
dashboard, the per-run ledger and the budget circuit breaker — which trips at
``AISOC_BUDGET_HARD_USD`` and would eventually degrade a working local
deployment to deterministic-only over money that was never spent.

Where the real number comes from
--------------------------------
The gateway resolved the alias, so the gateway is the only party that knows
what was actually called and what it cost. LiteLLM returns both on the
response headers. Measured against a real gateway (1.102.1) driving a local
Ollama model and a hosted model in the same config::

    alias           x-litellm-model-name    cost header
    aisoc-triage    ollama/qwen2:1.5b       x-litellm-response-cost-original: 0.0
    aisoc-summary   openai/gpt-4o-mini      x-litellm-response-cost:          1.35e-05

Same alias set, same request path: the local call is free and says so, the
hosted call carries the provider's real price. The alias alone distinguishes
neither.

``langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI`` only keeps response headers when built with
``include_response_headers=True``; without it ``response_metadata`` has no
``headers`` key at all and the cost is simply **not knowable from here** —
which is a third answer, distinct from zero and from an estimate.

Header selection is exact, never a prefix
-----------------------------------------
LiteLLM emits seven headers starting ``x-litellm-response-cost``:

    x-litellm-response-cost                     the total  (hosted call above)
    x-litellm-response-cost-original            the total before margin/discount
    x-litellm-response-cost-input               a component
    x-litellm-response-cost-output              a component
    x-litellm-response-cost-discount-amount     an adjustment
    x-litellm-response-cost-margin-amount       an adjustment
    x-litellm-response-cost-margin-percent      a *percentage*, not money

A prefix match would accept any of them, and ``-margin-percent`` is not even
denominated in dollars. Only the two totals are read, in a declared order, and
the self-test asserts a response carrying the five non-totals alone yields no
cost rather than a plausible-looking wrong one.

Stdlib only, and it never raises: a telemetry module that can throw would take
down the LLM call it is measuring.
