"""The hunting agent: a hypothesis in, a structured plan and findings out.

Gap-closure Phase 8.3.

A hunt starts as a sentence. "Did any service account log in interactively out
of hours." "Are we seeing the beaconing interval the advisory describes." The
work between that sentence and an answer is turning it into something a
warehouse can evaluate, and that is exactly the step a model is good at and
exactly the step it must not be trusted with unsupervised.

So the loop is: the model reads the hypothesis and produces a **plan** in the
closed vocabulary of :mod:`app.hunt.plan`; the platform validates it, compiles
it and runs it; the findings come back as evidence. The model never writes
query text, never names a field outside the published set, and never sees a
credential. Same boundary Phase 4 drew for the SIEM search, in a second place.

Three things this deliberately does not do
-------------------------------------------

**It does not promote anything.** A productive hunt can open a detection
proposal, and that proposal is a DRAFT on the existing governed path. Nothing
here writes a live rule, and the proposal carries the plan that produced it so
a reviewer reads a hunt rather than a suggestion.

**It does not retry a refusal silently.** A plan that names a field outside
the vocabulary comes back to the model with the reason and the alternatives,
once. A loop that quietly re-asks until something parses ends up running
whichever plan happened to validate, which is not the same as the plan that
answers the question.

**It does not invent a result when the lake is unreachable.** The three
outcomes the rest of this program keeps apart are kept apart here: findings,
no findings, and could not check.
