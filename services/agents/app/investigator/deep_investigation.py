"""Recursive, tool-driven investigation. The first production caller of the loop.

``run_with_tools`` — a working ReAct loop with tool execution, injection
guarding and cost telemetry — shipped with zero production callers. Every
investigation path fed the model one pre-serialised blob and asked for a
verdict, so the platform's deepest capability was reachable only from tests.

This module closes that. It selects an investigation strategy for the alert,
binds the investigation toolset, and runs the loop, so the model pivots
through the estate rather than summarising one payload.

What this deliberately is not: a workflow engine. The strategy supplies the
plan as guidance and the model chooses the tools. A hard-coded pivot sequence
would break on the first alert that did not match its shape, and would make
the loop decorative.

Three guardrails, because a loop that calls tools is a loop that spends money
and time on the hot path of every escalated alert:

* an iteration cap, inherited from ``run_with_tools``
* a wall-clock budget, since a slow pivot chain is worse than a shallow one
* a depth *record* on the result, so the investigation can be graded rather
  than assumed deep
