"""Recursive, tool-driven investigation. The first production caller of the loop.

``run_with_tools`` — a working ReAct loop with tool execution, injection
guarding and cost telemetry — shipped with zero production callers. Every
investigation path fed the model one pre-serialised blob and asked for a
verdict, so the platform's deepest capability was reachable only from tests.

This module closes that. It selects an investigation strategy for the alert,
binds the investigation toolset, and runs the loop, so the model pivots
through the estate rather than summarising one payload.

What this deliberately is not: a workflow engine. The strategy supplies the
plan as guidance and the model chooses the tools. A hard-coded pivot sequence
would break on the first alert that did not match its shape, and would make
the loop decorative.

Three guardrails, because a loop that calls tools is a loop that spends money
and time on the hot path of every escalated alert:

* an iteration cap, inherited from ``run_with_tools``
* a wall-clock budget, since a slow pivot chain is worse than a shallow one
* a depth *record* on the result, so the investigation can be graded rather
  than assumed deep

You have tools that query the organisation's own event lake. Use them. An
investigation is a chain of questions where each answer determines the next:
a suspicious process leads to where else that binary has run, which leads to
which accounts were on those hosts, which leads to where else those accounts
authenticated.

Rules that matter:
- Do not answer from the alert text alone. Call tools.
- Each tool result is the input to your next question, not the end of the
  enquiry.
- If a tool reports that its data class is not ingested, that is a gap in
  visibility. Record it as a gap. It is not evidence the activity did not
  happen.
- An empty result from a tool that *is* backed by data is genuine evidence of
  absence, and you may rely on it.
- Distinguish what you observed from what you inferred. State confidence
  plainly, and say what would change your mind.

Finish with a short narrative: what happened, in what order, what you are
confident about, what you could not determine, and what you would do next."""
