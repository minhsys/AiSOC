"""LLM factory — turn a task role into a ready chat model / model alias (#478).

Every live LLM call in ``services/agents`` asks for a **logical task alias**
(``aisoc-triage``, ``aisoc-recon``, …) rather than a concrete model. The LiteLLM
gateway (``infra/litellm/config.yaml``) owns the alias → real-model mapping and
any model-level fallback, so operators re-point models without touching code.
This module is the single place that resolves a role to ``(alias, base_url)`` and
hands back a configured chat model.

Since #478 there is **no hardcoded default model**. The alias comes from
:func:`app.llm.model_pins.get_pin`, which is env-overridable per role
(``AISOC_MODEL_PIN_<ROLE>``) so a deployment that calls a provider directly
instead of through the gateway can pin a concrete model. When no live LLM is
reachable, callers fall back to their deterministic path exactly as before — the
factory never forces a live call.

Which URL a model goes to, and which bearer goes with it, is
:mod:`app.llm.routing` — shared with the BYOK resolver and mirrored in the API
service. The short version: the compose-provided ``LLM_GATEWAY_URL`` is adopted
for an ``aisoc-<role>`` alias (it can resolve nowhere else) and left alone for a
concrete pinned model (which the gateway would not define), and an explicit
``OPENAI_BASE_URL`` always wins.

    Set ``json_output`` when the caller parses the reply as JSON. It asks the
    provider to constrain generation to a valid JSON object instead of leaving
    the model free to emit prose that merely looks like one.

    This is worth more than it sounds on a small local model. Measured over 50
    alerts through the gateway against the bundled
    ``llama3.2:3b-instruct-q4_K_M``, replies the triage parser could use went
    from 44/50 to 50/50. Every one of the six failures had a correct verdict and
    confidence and a malformed ``rationale`` — an unquoted value, or an invalid
    ``\\'`` escape. None was truncated. Constraining the grammar removes that
    class outright, which no amount of parsing after the fact can.

    Safe on providers that do not support it: the gateway ships
    ``drop_params: true`` (``infra/litellm/config.yaml``), so the parameter is
    dropped rather than erroring, and the caller degrades to today's behaviour.
