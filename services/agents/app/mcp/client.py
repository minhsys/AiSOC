"""The MCP client: one session, bounded, validated immediately before it opens.

Gap-closure Phase 5.1 and 5.4. Built on the official MCP Python SDK, pinned
exactly in ``pyproject.toml``. Two things are worth reading here.

The SSRF guard runs here and not in the registry
------------------------------------------------
``services/api`` refuses an obviously unsafe URL at save time so an operator
gets an immediate answer, but the enforcing check is the one in this module,
called in :meth:`McpClient.session` after the configuration has been read and
before the transport is constructed. A hostname that resolved to a public
address when somebody pressed save can resolve to ``169.254.169.254`` an hour
later, so a check performed once at save time proves nothing about the request
that eventually goes out. The air-gap policy is applied at the same point and
for the same reason.

The byte cap is enforced on the socket, not on the way out
-----------------------------------------------------------
A cap applied to the parsed result bounds what reaches the prompt but not what
reaches memory, and an MCP server that answers with a gigabyte would take the
container down before the cap was consulted. :class:`_CappedTransport` counts
bytes as they arrive and aborts past the tenant's limit, so the bound holds at
the point where it costs something. The parsed result is capped again on the
way into the prompt, because those are two different budgets: the socket cap
protects the process, the prompt cap protects the context window.

Transport
---------
Streamable HTTP only. ``policy.vet_server`` refuses a stdio server unless an
operator has switched stdio on and allowlisted the command; this module raises
on one it is handed anyway, rather than quietly falling back to HTTP, because
a client that silently ignores the transport it was told to use is a client
nobody can reason about.

    TimeoutError`` with the ``ResponseTooLarge`` nowhere in the tree.
    Measured by walking the group on a 400 KB body under a 4 KB cap, not
    assumed.

    A ``ContextVar`` was tried first and cannot work: a context propagates
    *into* a child task, so a value set by the reader is invisible to the
    coroutine that awaited it. This is shared by reference instead, from the
    client down to the stream that trips it.

    It matters because ``app.mcp.tools._failure`` reports
    ``type(exc).__name__`` to the model and to the ledger. Left alone, a
    tenant's own byte cap firing is recorded as the server being slow, which
