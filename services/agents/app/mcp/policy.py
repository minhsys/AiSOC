"""What an MCP server may be, and what one of its tools may become.

Gap-closure Phase 5.1 and 5.3. Pure and synchronous: no network, no database,
no SDK import. That is the point. Every decision in this module has to be
reachable without opening a socket, because the decision this phase exists to
get right is the one taken *before* the socket opens.

An MCP server is somebody else's code, reached over the network, whose replies
land in the prompt that decides what the agent does next. Three defaults
follow from that, and each is here rather than in configuration:

**Streamable HTTP only.** A stdio server is a local process the agent starts.
That is code execution on the agents container, not an HTTP request, so it
stays refused unless an operator has both switched stdio on and named the
command. Two switches rather than one, because either alone is a setting
somebody flips while debugging.

**Read-only.** A tool is callable when the operator allowlisted it by name
*and* the server has not said it changes state. Both halves matter and they
say different things: the allowlist is the tenant's assertion, the annotation
is the vendor's. Either one saying no is a no. An unannotated tool is callable
only because an operator wrote its name down, and an empty allowlist, which is
the default, means the agent may call nothing at all.

A tool the server marks destructive is not a configuration option. It is
refused here and reachable, if at all, only through governed dispatch as a
live action with a declared capability contract. No MCP tool has such a
contract today, so the honest reading of "or not at all" is the one in force.

**The description is attacker-controlled too.** The server supplies it, and it
goes into the tool-selection prompt, so a malicious description is an
injection into the prompt that chooses what to call, which arrives before any
result does. :func:`vet_tool` scans the name, the description, the title and
every parameter description, and drops the tool on a high-severity hit rather
than sanitising it: a description trying to instruct the model has no
legitimate use, so there is nothing to preserve. What survives is sanitised,
length-capped, and its schema is projected down to the keys a tool schema
needs, so a server cannot smuggle arbitrary JSON into what the model is shown.

That last control is the load-bearing one, and the guard's own measurements
are why. The guard was hardened after this phase's corpus was built: it now
scores 0.96 on prose and 98.1% on the corpus of payloads written to fit a
constrained field, up from 0.852 and 66.7%. But graded against 28 payloads
authored *after* the change, it catches **2**. An MCP server's payload is
held-out data by definition, written by somebody who has read whatever the
guard published, so 7.1% is the figure that applies here rather than 98.1%.
The structural limits are what hold, because they hold whatever the guard
scores.
