"""Turn an MCP result into something safe to put in a prompt.

Gap-closure Phase 5.4.

An MCP result is text a third party chose, arriving into the conversation that
decides what an agent does next. It is exactly the class of input the nonce
envelope and the injection guard were built for, so this module applies both
rather than inventing a third mechanism.

Three controls, in the order they run:

1. **Cap.** The serialised content is truncated to the tenant's limit before
   anything else looks at it. Scanning a megabyte to decide whether to keep
   the first 64 kB is wasted work, and the remainder is not going into the
   prompt anyway. The truncation is *stated* in the returned object, because
   a model that does not know a list was cut will reason about it as complete.

2. **Fence.** The content is wrapped in the run's nonce envelope, which is the
   same containment auto-triage uses. The nonce is unguessable at the time a
   payload was planted, so fenced text cannot forge its own closing marker,
   and any occurrence of the nonce inside the body is stripped before wrapping
   so a leaked one cannot be reused within the run.

3. **Scan.** The injection guard runs over the content and its verdict travels
   with the result, in the return value and in the ledger. It is not a filter,
   and its own held-out measurement says why: against 28 payloads authored
   after its last hardening it detects 2. It scores 0.96 on prose and 98.1% on
   the corpus it was tuned against, but an MCP server's payload is held-out
   data by definition. The fence and the standing system rule are what hold
   when the guard misses; the guard is what makes a miss visible afterwards.

The returned object also carries a first-party boundary sentence. The standing
system rule is added to the system message by the caller that builds the
prompt, and this sentence is the same statement made inline, so a result is
self-describing even in a conversation where the rule was not added.
