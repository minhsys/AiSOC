"""Ask the API to run one playbook step as a governed action.

The engine does not dispatch. This module is one authenticated POST, a
structured log line, and no policy — deliberately, because the API holds the
credential vault and the tenant session, and ``services/actions`` owns the
per-capability contract that decides whether a verb may run at all. A second
opinion here would be a second place that can isolate a customer's host.

Fail closed, not fail soft
--------------------------
``siem_writeback`` next door fails *soft*: the verdict is already durable by
the time it runs and a Splunk outage must not undo it. This is the opposite
case. A step that says it blocked an address and did not must never be
recorded as a success, so every failure path here returns a report with
``executed: false`` and the engine fails the step. The default
``on_failure: abort`` then halts the run, which is the behaviour an operator
reading "block the C2 address" expects when it did not happen.

Preview by default
------------------
``AISOC_PLAYBOOK_ACTIONS_EXECUTE`` is **off** unless an operator turns it on,
so a playbook previews its response steps and reports them as previews. The
switch is read here *and* honoured downstream by the same
``dry_run``-defaults-true rule in ``actions_client``, so neither end can turn
it on alone.
