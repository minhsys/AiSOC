"""Start a playbook from a fused alert. Off by default, preview before live.

Parity plan 5.1: "`find_matching()` has no production caller today. Call it
from the fused-alert path behind a setting that ships off. A playbook first
runs in preview, with its plan and simulated steps shown on the alert, and
then goes live per tenant and per playbook."

Why three switches rather than one
-----------------------------------
A playbook that runs from an alert is the most consequential thing in this
product: it can isolate a host nobody asked it to. One global flag is not
enough granularity to turn that on safely, so there are three and **all**
must agree:

1. the deployment switch, off by default;
2. the tenant, which must have opted in;
3. the playbook itself, which must be marked live rather than preview.

A playbook that clears the first two still runs in **preview**: its plan
and its simulated steps attach to the alert so an analyst can read what it
would have done. Going live is a separate, per-playbook decision made
after reading that.

The ordering matters: preview is the default state, not a mode somebody
has to remember to use first.
