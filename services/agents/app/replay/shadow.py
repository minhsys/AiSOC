"""Shadow mode: the production triage path, writing nothing, reading a frozen world.

Gap-closure Phase 1.2.

These are the two halves of the replay's honesty, and they fail in opposite
directions.

:class:`ShadowTriageWriter` implements every method of
``app.workers.triage_persistence.TriageWriter`` and performs none of them. It
counts each call instead, so "wrote nothing" is a number a test can assert on
rather than an absence a test has to prove. An absence proves nothing: a
replay that never reached the writeback branch and a replay whose writeback
was suppressed look identical from outside.

:class:`FrozenTriageContextReader` implements the read port so that every
source is held at the split. This is the leak the plan cares about. Without it
the sequence is:

    triage alert 140 -> verdict benign -> prior written -> triage alert 141
    -> reads the prior -> auto-suppressed -> graded "correct"

and the evaluation has graded the agent on an answer it supplied itself three
seconds earlier. Freezing the reads closes the second half of that; the shadow
writer closes the first. Both are needed: a frozen reader over a live writer
still pollutes the store for the *next* run, and a null writer over a live
reader still picks up whatever the console wrote while the replay was running.

Two kinds of freeze, because two kinds of store
-----------------------------------------------
Gap-closure Phase 6.3 added context sources that cannot be frozen the way the
first three were, and the difference is size rather than taste.

A **snapshot** source is small enough to capture whole, once, before the test
window runs: a tenant's organisation-memory statements, its outcome priors,
its active skills. :func:`capture_context` filters the captured set against
the split and :meth:`ContextSnapshot.as_method_note` publishes what survived
and what did not.

A **cutoff** source is a per-alert query against a store that can hold
everything a SOC has ever written. There is nothing to capture, so the freeze
is a parameter: :class:`FrozenTriageContextReader` passes ``split_at`` as an
``as_of`` and the store is what refuses the late rows. The reader accumulates
what was served and what was refused across the run, and publishes them
through :meth:`FrozenTriageContextReader.as_method_note` using the same key
names the snapshot half uses, so a report has one vocabulary rather than two.

The refused count is the part worth insisting on. A cutoff that matched
nothing and a cutoff that threw away fifty documents return the same empty
list, so without the count a reader cannot tell a working freeze from an
inert one. ``scripts/check_triage_context_freeze.py`` enforces both halves, in
both directions, and knows which kind each source is because
``CONTEXT_FREEZE_KINDS`` declares it.

On the timestamps that are not there
------------------------------------
:func:`capture_context` drops any statement or prior carrying a recorded time
after the split. Organisation-memory statements as served by
``GET /feedback/context-statements`` carry no creation time at all: the query
in ``app/services/analyst_feedback.py`` selects ``statement``, ``reason_code``,
``scope``, ``scope_value``, ``observations`` and ``expires_at``, and nothing
else. So for those rows the filter has nothing to test and they are kept.

That is a real limit and it is counted rather than hidden:
:attr:`ContextSnapshot.undated_statements` travels into the report, so a reader
sees how much of the frozen context could actually be checked against the
split. Silently dropping them would understate the context production gets;
silently keeping them while claiming a clean point-in-time freeze would
overstate the guarantee.

Tenant skills, and the one thing here that bypasses the split on purpose
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gap-closure Phase 6.2 added a fourth store. A tenant skill carries
``activated_at``, so unlike an organisation-memory statement it *can* be
tested against the split, and :func:`capture_context` drops one activated
after it exactly as it drops a late statement.

:attr:`ContextSnapshot.skills_under_test` is the deliberate exception, and it
is the honest way to do the one thing a skill backtest has to do. Measuring a
skill authored today against history from last quarter means applying guidance
whose author may have read those very alerts. Freezing it out would make the
backtest measure nothing; applying it silently would publish an accuracy
number an author could raise by writing a skill that restates the labels. So
the candidate travels in its own field, the method note names it and counts it
separately from the frozen set, and
:meth:`ContextSnapshot.as_method_note` publishes the caveat rather than
leaving a reader to work it out. A skill under test is scored, and the reader
is told the score is a statement about this window rather than a forecast.
