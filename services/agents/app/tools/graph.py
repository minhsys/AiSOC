    Two reasons, and telling them apart matters to whoever reads the log.

    The graph routes on the API authenticate with `get_current_user`, which
    validates a **user** JWT. A background worker has no user, so a service
    token does not open them: before this, `ContextBundleBuilder()` was
    constructed with no token on the production path and every graph read
    during auto-triage answered 401, four warnings per alert, on every
    entity. That reads like a broken integration rather than a capability
    that is not present.

    And on CORE there is no graph at all. Neo4j runs in the `full` profile,
