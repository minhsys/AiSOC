"""Auto-triage every fused alert off the Kafka stream (Phase B1).

The reality audit's core autonomy gap: investigations were manual/API-only —
nothing consumed ``aisoc.alerts.fused`` to actually run the agent, so the
platform's headline claim (an agent that triages *every* alert, like a leading
AI-SOC) was not true out of the box. This worker closes that: it subscribes to
the fused-alert topic and runs auto-triage on each alert.

**Copilot / dry-run is the default.** Triage is *read-only*: the worker
classifies the alert (verdict + calibrated confidence), records the reasoning
to the Investigation Ledger, and stops. It NEVER executes a response action —
proposed actions carry ``requires_approval=True`` and are surfaced for a human
(or a tenant that has explicitly raised its L0-L4 autonomy tier — that wiring
is B2/C3). ``response_dispatched`` is therefore always ``False`` here.

Tier selection is cost- and determinism-aware, in this order (each degrades
safely to the deterministic tier, which needs no LLM key — the air-gapped /
no-key / CI default):

1. cost-governor ``DEDUPLICATED`` → reuse the cached verdict (a flood of
   identical alerts costs one triage, not N);
2. governor ``CIRCUIT_OPEN`` / ``AISOC_DETERMINISTIC`` / no LLM key →
   deterministic heuristic triage (``run_triage``);
3. otherwise → LLM auto-triage (``run_auto_triage``), falling back to
   deterministic triage if the LLM call fails.

Everything is fail-soft: a bad message is logged and skipped; a ledger/DB
outage degrades to "triage still runs, audit write is a no-op"; the Kafka loop
never dies on one poison alert.
