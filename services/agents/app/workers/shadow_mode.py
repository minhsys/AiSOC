"""Shadow mode on the live queue: triage runs, and nothing it says is acted on.

Gap-closure Phase 2.1.

Phase 1 built shadow execution for replay, over a customer's *closed* history:
:class:`app.replay.shadow.ShadowTriageWriter` implements every write the
triage path makes and performs none of them. This is the same seam pointed at
live alerts, and it differs in exactly one way that matters.

A replay writes nothing at all, because its findings are already closed and
anything it wrote would be noise in a store somebody else reads. A live shadow
run has to write two things: the verdict, so an analyst can see what the agent
thought, and a decision row, so agreement can be measured when that analyst
closes the alert. What it must not do is *act*: no disposition set on the
alert, no auto-closure, no writeback to the source SIEM, no approval queued,
no outcome prior recorded, no escalation into the investigation graph.

The one that is easy to get wrong
=================================

``ledger.persist_auto_triage`` writes ``alerts.disposition``. That column is
the analyst's verdict, set from the feedback endpoint, and it is also the
column reconciliation reads to learn what the analyst decided. Letting a
shadow verdict land in it would mean the agent filled in the answer it is
about to be graded against, and every alert an analyst did not explicitly
re-dispose would score as perfect agreement.

That is the Phase 1 leakage lesson arriving by a different route, and it is
the reason ``persist_auto_triage`` grew a ``shadow`` flag rather than this
module simply forwarding the call. Under that flag the ledger still writes the
run, the event and the ``ai_score`` / ``ai_summary`` /
``ai_recommendations`` columns, which are the agent's own fields, and leaves
``disposition``, ``status`` and ``resolved_at`` untouched. The analyst decides
from a blank field, which is the only way their closure is independent
evidence.

Cost is not suppressed
======================

:attr:`ShadowModeTriageWriter.persists_cost` is ``True``. A shadow run places
real model calls against a real key, and a tenant measuring for a month must
see that spend. Replay declines it because a replay is a measurement the
tenant asked for and should not be billed twice for; a shadow run is the
product running.

Deduplication is not suppressed either
======================================

:meth:`~ShadowModeTriageWriter.cache_verdict` forwards. Production dedups an
alert flood through the cost governor, so a shadow run that did not would cost
more than the thing it is modelling and would measure a pipeline the tenant
will never operate. Replay declines it for a reason that does not apply here:
in a replay the cache is a third route by which the test window answers
itself, and on a live queue there is no test window.

Which way it fails
==================

:class:`LiveShadowModePolicy` distinguishes "no database configured" from
"database configured and unreadable", the same distinction
``app.services.tenant_policy`` draws in the actions service and for the same
reason. No database means no shadow table, no tenant could have enabled
anything, and nowhere to record a decision: shadow is off. A configured
database that will not answer means a tenant may well have asked for shadow
and we cannot see it, so the run is treated as shadow. Acting on an alert a
tenant asked us only to observe is the worse of the two errors, and the other
one is a few seconds of writeback that resumes on the next read.
