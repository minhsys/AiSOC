"""Adversarial prompt-injection corpus for tool results.

Pillar 2 multiplied the untrusted content reaching the model. An enrichment
verdict read one pre-serialised alert; a pivot chain feeds the model SIEM
rows, graph properties, threat-intel records and vendor error strings, and
every one of them is text somebody else wrote. A strategy library makes that
worse, because it makes the model *want* to keep reading.

The payloads below are grouped by what the attacker is trying to achieve
rather than by phrasing, because phrasing is the part that changes. A guard
tuned to "ignore previous instructions" is tuned to last year's corpus.

Where the content lands matters as much as its text. A hostname is rendered
in a different position from a SIEM row's free-text message, and a guard
that scans one and not the other is a guard with a hole. Each payload
therefore carries the field it arrives in.
