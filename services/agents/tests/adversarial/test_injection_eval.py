"""Adversarial eval: does the guard hold against tool results it has not seen?

Pillar 2 multiplied the untrusted content reaching the model. An enrichment
verdict read one pre-serialised alert; a pivot chain feeds it SIEM rows,
graph properties, threat-intel records and vendor error strings — all text
somebody else wrote, and a strategy library makes the model *want* to keep
reading.

This is an eval rather than a unit test: it reports a rate against a corpus
and enforces a floor, because a guard is never going to catch everything and
pretending otherwise produces a suite that gets weakened whenever it fails.

Two floors, and the second is the one that matters. Recall stops the guard
degrading. **Precision stops the guard being turned off** — a guard that
flags a phishing alert's own body, or a malware config the analyst needs to
read, is a guard someone disables within a week, and then the recall number
describes nothing.
