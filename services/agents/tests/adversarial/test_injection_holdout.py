"""The held-out corpus, and the properties that make its number mean anything.

There is deliberately no floor here and no assertion that the rate is good.
The rate is 7.1% and that is the finding; a test that required it to be
higher would be a standing instruction to tune against this corpus, which is
the one thing that would destroy it. What is asserted instead is everything
that has to be true for the number to be readable at all: the payloads are
disjoint from the corpus the guard was hardened against, the twins differ in
one field so a hit is attributable, and the recorded misses describe this
tree in both directions.
