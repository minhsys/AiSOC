"""Properties the incident corpus has to hold, or its rates mean nothing.

Every metric in this suite is a difference between two runs over twins that
differ in exactly one field. If that property fails, a "verdict flip" could
be attributable to anything, and the number would still look fine. So the
twin invariant is asserted rather than assumed, and so is the one that the
first measurement taken here got wrong: a guard detection has to be
attributable to the payload rather than to the incident carrying it.
