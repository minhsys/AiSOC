"""Context overflow and privilege escalation, against the real controls.

Gap-closure wave 4.

Context overflow was absent, and absent in a way the existing corpus could
not reach by growing: every payload in it is a short string in a field.

Overflow's payload is the *volume*, not the text, so a guard that reads
prose for instruction-shaped phrasing has nothing to catch.

The privilege-escalation half of this wave lives in
`services/actions/tests/test_privilege_escalation.py`, because it must
be graded by the shipped approval matrix and both services root their
packages at `app` — loading one from the other binds to the wrong tree.

These run against `PromptInjectionGuard` and `approval_matrix.evaluate`
as shipped. Where a control does not stop something, the test records
the measurement rather than asserting a pass, because tuning a guard
against the corpus that measures it has already been shown here to move
66.7% to 98.1% while held-out payloads moved 3.6% to 7.1%.
