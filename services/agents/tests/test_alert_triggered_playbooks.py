"""A playbook starts from an alert, in preview, behind three switches.

Parity plan 5.1: "`find_matching()` has no production caller today. Call
it from the fused-alert path behind a setting that ships off. A playbook
first runs in preview, with its plan and simulated steps shown on the
alert, and then goes live per tenant and per playbook."

Why the switches are tested harder than the matching
-----------------------------------------------------
A playbook that runs from an alert can isolate a host nobody asked it to.
The matching logic already existed and was already tested; what did not
exist was any caller, and what matters now is that turning the caller on
is deliberate at three independent levels and that the **default of every
one of them is off**.

The ordering is the part worth pinning: preview is the default state, not
a mode somebody has to remember to use first. A deployment that enables
the feature and forgets the per-playbook list gets previews, not actions.
