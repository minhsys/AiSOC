"""No raw hostname, user, IP, domain or email reaches a hosted model.

Parity plan 2.4, and the gate claim-matrix row 19 now rests on.

The point of this file
----------------------
Row 19 ("no data exfiltration") used to be gated by
`test_privacy_redactor.py`, which calls the redactor directly and asserts it
redacts. That is a true statement about a function. It said nothing about
the product, because **no LLM call site invoked the redactor**, and parity
1.1 had to retract the claim for exactly that reason.

So these tests drive `safe_ainvoke`, the function every LLM call in
`services/agents` passes through, and inspect what the fake provider
actually received. A test that calls the redactor cannot tell a wired
control from an unwired one; a test that inspects the outbound payload can.
