"""An auto-escalated alert must be investigated as deeply as a manual one.

Three gaps in investigation depth, all the same shape: a capability was built,
and the path that needed it did not use it.

1. The manual investigator orchestrator has built a `ContextBundle` — graph
   neighbourhood, blast radius, historical verdicts for the same entities,
   UEBA baselines — since T2.1. The escalation path the auto-triage worker
   uses never did, so the high-volume automatic route investigated with
   strictly less context than a human clicking "investigate" on the identical
   alert.

2. `run_with_tools` is described in its own module docstring as "the primitive
   that lets specialist agents use tools instead of reasoning over a single
   pre-serialised blob", and called `bound.ainvoke` directly — bypassing the
   LLM input contract on the one place in the system where untrusted content
   is fed back into a prompt.

3. QRadar's AQL translator was written, exported and tested, and the connector
   type was missing from the API's federated-capable set.
