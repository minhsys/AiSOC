"""The test window must not be able to influence its own triage.

Gap-closure Phase 1.5, and the test the phase is really about. A replay report
whose test window fed itself is worse than no report: it is a number with a
method section that reads correctly and a result that is circular.

Four routes exist from a test-window decision back into a later test-window
decision, and they run through four different stores. Each gets its own test,
because "no leakage" failing as one assertion tells a future reader nothing
about which of them broke.

1. **Outcome memory.** Production writes every durable verdict back as a
   per-signature prior, and looks a prior up *before* triage. Two findings
   with the same canonical evidence therefore chain: the first alert's verdict
   auto-closes the second without re-triage. Under replay that is the
   evaluation answering its own next question.
2. **The cost governor's dedup cache.** Keyed on the same evidence
   fingerprint, and it short-circuits earlier still, returning the cached
   verdict as tier ``cached``. It leaves no ledger row and no memory prior, so
   the first two defences would both report clean while this one leaked.
3. **Organisation memory.** Compiled from analyst feedback and read into the
   triage prompt. Nothing in the test window writes a statement directly, but
   the read is live in production and a mid-run refresh picks up whatever the
   console wrote while the replay was running.
4. **Tenant skills** (Phase 6.1). Customer-authored guidance that reaches the
   same prompt, and the one store here whose rows are *written to influence
   verdicts on purpose*. A skill activated during the test window, or authored
   after it by somebody who read it, steers every later alert it matches.
   Unlike organisation memory these rows carry ``activated_at``, so the split
   filter has something to test and the freeze can be complete rather than
   partial.

   The deliberate bypass is tested here too, in its own test rather than as an
   exception buried in another. ``skills_under_test`` is how a backtest
   applies a candidate to a window that closed before it was written, and the
   property under test is not that it is refused, it is that the method note
   **names it and carries the caveat**. An unfiltered store nobody is told
   about is indistinguishable from a leak.
5. **Knowledge-base runbooks** (Phase 6.3), and the first source here that a
   snapshot cannot hold. The other four are captured whole before the window
   runs; a knowledge base is queried per alert against a corpus that can hold
   everything a SOC has written, so the freeze is a cutoff the frozen reader
   supplies and the server applies. A runbook written *after* an incident,
   which is when runbooks are usually written, is the leak: it describes the
   very alerts the test window is about.

   Two properties rather than one, because the cutoff has two halves that fail
   separately. The rows that reach the prompt must be the ones that existed at
   the split, and the count of what the server refused must reach the method
   note. A cutoff that matched nothing and a cutoff that refused fifty
   documents produce the same empty list.
6. **Recent analyst decisions** (Phase 6.3), and the most direct leak of the
   seven. A decision recorded inside the test window *is* an analyst's answer
   to an alert in that window, so a replay that could see them would grade the
   agent against the labels it is about to be marked on.
7. **Directory context** (Phase 6.3), whose freeze is deliberately partial. An
   ``Employee`` node carries when it was imported, never when the fact became
   true, so a provably late import is refused and every surviving row is
   counted as untestable. The property under test is that the partial freeze
   is *published as partial*, the same discipline
   ``statements_without_timestamp`` established.

Every test here is checked for sensitivity
-------------------------------------------
A leakage test that passes because nothing happens is the most likely thing to
ship and the least useful. So each test also runs the *unprotected*
configuration and asserts it leaks. If a future change makes the leak
unreachable for some unrelated reason, the sensitivity half fails and says so,
rather than the whole file going quietly green over a property it no longer
tests.
