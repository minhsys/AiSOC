"""The replay route: the tenant comes from the credential, and nothing is written.

Gap-closure Phase 1.4 gate.

Phase 1.2 proved the runner splits, freezes and writes nothing. This proves
the route in front of it resolves the tenant from the caller's credential
rather than from the request, refuses a history it cannot read rather than
grading a partial one, and reaches the production normalizer over HTTP rather
than substituting a mapping of its own.

The tenant assertions are the ones that matter. The tenant travels into the
envelope handed to triage, so a caller-supplied tenant would decide which
customer's business-context rules and institutional memory the graded verdict
was produced under.
