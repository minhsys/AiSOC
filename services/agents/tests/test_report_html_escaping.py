"""The incident report's fallback renderer must not emit untrusted HTML.

`_md_to_html` uses the `markdown` package when it is importable and wraps the
source in `<pre>` when it is not. The fallback interpolated the Markdown raw,
and the title interpolated the case id raw.

Found while fixing GHSA-w754-prh8-m56j, by looking for the same shape
elsewhere. What makes it worth a test rather than a quiet fix is that the
sibling renderer in `app/orchestrator/report.py` already escapes here, and its
comment says why in as many words: "a raw `<pre>` wrap would leak HTML through
unchanged". One copy of the lesson was written down and the other copy did the
thing it warns about.

The content is not trustworthy: the Markdown is model output and the report
embeds connector-supplied entity names, so a hostname or filename carried in
from an alert reaches an analyst's browser.
