"""Shadow mode on the live queue: it records, and it does not act.

Gap-closure Phase 2.1.

The property under test is not "fewer writes happen". It is that the agent
never fills in the answer it is about to be graded against. ``alerts.disposition``
is the analyst's column and the column reconciliation reads, so a shadow
verdict landing there would make every alert an analyst did not explicitly
re-dispose score as perfect agreement, and the scorecard would climb toward a
promotion on nothing at all.

That is the Phase 1 leakage lesson arriving by a different route. Phase 1's
version was a verdict written as an outcome prior that suppressed the next
alert; this one is a verdict written into the field the next measurement
reads. Both are the evaluation answering itself.
