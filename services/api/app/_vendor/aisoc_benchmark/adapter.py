"""The adapter protocol: what any SOC agent must implement to be graded.

Pillar 4. A benchmark a vendor cannot run against their own product is a
self-report. The existing harness grades the in-tree agent by importing it,
which means the numbers are only ever about AiSOC — and a scoreboard with one
entrant is a marketing page.

This is the boundary that makes it a standard instead. An agent is anything
that takes an incident and returns a verdict, so the protocol is deliberately
small: four fields in, five fields out, no imports from this repository
required. A vendor implements it in twenty lines against their own API and
gets graded on the same corpus by the same code.

Three deliberate exclusions:

* **No tool interface.** How an agent reaches evidence is its business. The
  benchmark supplies the incident and the telemetry corpus and grades the
  answer; prescribing the tools would grade architecture rather than
  outcomes, and would exclude every agent that does not look like ours.
* **No prompt.** Same reason.
* **No partial credit for effort.** An agent that called forty tools and
  concluded wrongly scores as wrongly as one that guessed. Depth is reported
  separately because it explains a score; it is not a score.

What *is* prescribed is the shape of the answer, because the metrics depend
on it — specifically on being able to tell a confident wrong answer from an
abstention, and a cited indicator from an invented one.
