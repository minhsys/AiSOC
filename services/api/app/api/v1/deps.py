"""FastAPI dependency injection.

Authentication supports two credential types:
  1. JWT Bearer token   – issued by /auth/login
  2. API key Bearer     – prefixed with "aisoc_", validated against the api_keys table

API key auth carries explicit ``scopes``; JWT auth derives permissions from the
user's role via ``ROLE_PERMISSIONS``.

Multi-tenant Row-Level Security (RLS)
--------------------------------------
Use ``TenantDBSession`` (from ``app.db.rls``) instead of ``DBSession`` for
endpoints that must be tenant-isolated at the database level.  It sets the
Postgres session variable ``app.current_tenant_id`` before yielding, which
activates the RLS policies defined in ``migrations/002_rls.sql``.

    cross-tenant leak this codebase has had took the other shape, a scope that
    was absent rather than narrow and a read that treated absent as "no
    filter".

    The tenant is checked against the table. The header is caller-supplied,
    and ``POST /v1/ingest/batch`` once trusted exactly such a header with

    This used to consult the hardcoded `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` map only, while a
    second factory, `require_permission_db`, consulted the `user_roles` /
    `role_permissions` tables the console's RBAC administration surface
    writes to. 275 routes used the first and 27 used the second, so an
    operator could grant a permission, watch it appear in the UI, and have
    275 of 302 routes ignore it.

    The resolution happens once, in `get_current_user`, where a session
    already exists — not here. A query per permission check would mean a
    database blip denies every request, turning a transient fault into a
    platform-wide outage at the authorization layer, and it broke 84 tests
    that legitimately drive routes with a mocked session.

    So this stays synchronous and reads what authentication resolved.

    API keys keep their own path. A key's scopes are an explicit, narrower
    grant chosen at mint time — resolving a key to its owner's full role
    would widen it, which is the opposite of what a scoped key is for.
