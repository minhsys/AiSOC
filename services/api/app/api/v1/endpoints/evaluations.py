"""Replay evaluation: start a run, poll it, read the report, export it.

Gap-closure Phase 1.4.

Not to be confused with ``endpoints/replay.py``
----------------------------------------------
That module publishes a redacted investigation ledger to a public share link
at ``/r/{slug}``. It is a different noun that happens to share a word, and it
is deliberately not extended here: a reader looking for share-link publishing
should not be handed replay evaluation, and the two have opposite privacy
postures. This one is tenant-scoped and authenticated throughout.

The tenant never appears in a request
--------------------------------------
Every route takes ``user.tenant_id`` from the authenticated principal. There
is no tenant field on any payload and no tenant path parameter. The connector
is named by its row id, and that row is loaded with a tenant predicate, so
naming another tenant's connector is a 404 rather than a read.

Permissions
-----------
Starting a run needs ``connectors:write``, the same bar as testing a
connector, because it does the same kind of thing: an outbound call to a
customer's own SIEM using stored credentials. Reading a report needs
``reports:read``, which every analyst role holds, because the report is the
artefact the evaluation exists to produce.
