"""Knowledge-base + RAG over org docs/runbooks (tier3-rag).

Analysts ingest organisation documents (runbooks, policies, playbooks, SOPs)
into a full-text-searchable store.  A ``/query`` endpoint retrieves relevant
chunks and, when an LLM key is configured, synthesises a cited answer.

Endpoints
---------
* ``POST /kb/ingest``       Ingest a document (chunked automatically).
* ``GET  /kb/documents``    List indexed documents.
* ``GET  /kb/documents/{id}`` Get a document.
* ``DELETE /kb/documents/{id}`` Remove a document.
* ``POST /kb/query``        Semantic/keyword search + optional LLM synthesis.
* ``GET  /kb/runbooks/for-triage`` Internal: retrieval for the agents service,
  with a point-in-time cutoff. Gap-closure Phase 6.3.

Authorization
-------------
``POST /ingest`` and ``DELETE /documents/{id}`` require ``settings:write``.
The knowledge base is the tenant's operational content of record — runbooks,
policies, SOPs — and the delete is wider than its path suggests: it removes
*every chunk sharing the document's title*, tenant-wide, so one request from a
``viewer`` erased a runbook for everybody. It is also what the agents service
retrieves during triage, so a document planted here is a document the model
is told to follow.

``POST /query`` is deliberately **left ungated** and counted in
``scripts/check_route_authz.py``'s ledger. Searching the runbook library is
something every role should be able to do, and the vocabulary has no
knowledge-base permission: every candidate is either held by every role
including machine keys (``cases:read``, ``reports:read``) or restricted to
tenant administrators (``settings:read``), which would take the runbooks away
from the analysts who need them mid-incident. Choosing one on the strength of
its role list rather than what the route does would be reverse-engineering a
permission from the answer. The open questions are whether reading the
library is an entitlement at all and whether LLM synthesis — which spends the
tenant's budget — needs a stronger one than retrieval; both are product
decisions, not gaps to be papered over.

    honest when it does.

    Why a cutoff rather than a captured snapshot. The other three context
    stores are small enough that a replay freezes them by capturing the whole
    set once. This one is a per-alert query against a corpus that can hold
    every document a SOC has ever written, so there is nothing sensible to

    supplies the split instant and the predicate lands in the SQL above, which
    is also why the counts come back beside the rows. A cutoff that silently
    matched nothing and a cutoff that refused fifty documents are the same
    empty list from outside.

    ``as_of`` is deliberately not defaulted. A default of "now" would make an
    unfrozen caller look frozen, and a default of the epoch would make every
    live triage return nothing.

    The token is checked in band rather than through a bearer dependency, the
    same shape ``/tenant-skills/resolved/active`` and ``/mcp-servers/resolved``
    use, because the caller is a service with no session. ``tenant_id`` is the
