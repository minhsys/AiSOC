"""What a new tenant still has to do, and one button that gives them data.

Why the console needs this
---------------------------
A brand-new operator signed in and landed on `/dashboard`: every tile
zero, every panel an honest empty state, and no indication of what to do
next. The empty states were correct — that work is done — but correct and
*useful* are different things, and "0 connected sources" does not tell
anyone where the button is.

`GET /status` answers "what is set up and what is not" from the database
rather than from a flag, so it stays true if somebody connects a source
through the API, or deletes one, or arrives at a tenant that was
onboarded months ago.

`POST /sample-data` is the other half of the answer. An evaluator who has
not yet got credentials for their EDR still needs to see the product do
something, and the honest way to give them that is to run the real
pipeline rather than to insert rows — see `app/services/sample_data.py`
for why that distinction matters.
