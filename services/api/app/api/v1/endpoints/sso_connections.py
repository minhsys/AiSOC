"""Configure which identity provider signs a tenant's users in.

Wave 0 of the gap-closure plan.

`aisoc_sso_connections` has existed since migration 080 and nothing has
ever written to it. `sso_provisioning.resolve_connection` selects from it
on every SAML and OIDC sign-in and returns `None` when there is no row,
which raises `SsoProvisioningError` and answers **403**. So both SSO
paths were complete, tested, and unreachable: a deployment could not sign
a single user in through an identity provider without someone writing an
`INSERT` by hand.

Why the tenant lives here and not in the assertion
----------------------------------------------------
This is the design decision the table was built around, and it is worth
restating at the write path because this module is where it could be
undone. An identity provider that can name its own tenant can name
somebody else's, so the tenant is a property of the *connection* an
administrator configured. The assertion only says who the person is.

The same reasoning governs group mapping: an IdP group confers a role
only because an administrator in this deployment said it should.

What this refuses
-----------------
**A mapping to `admin` or `platform_admin`.** v14.0.0 made those
unreachable from every API route so that only `bootstrap_admin` can mint
one, and a group mapping would be a way back in — register an issuer,
claim a group, hold the wildcard. The check runs against
`role_grants.authorize_role_grant` rather than a local list, because a
second list would eventually disagree with the first.

**An issuer another tenant already claims.** The unique index enforces
it, but a 409 naming the conflict is more useful than an integrity
error, and it deliberately does not say which tenant holds it.

**A connection a caller cannot reach.** Every route is tenant-scoped on
the session, so one tenant cannot read, edit or delete another's
connection even knowing its id.
