"""Usage metering: what a tenant did, counted from the rows that record it.

The tenant comes from the credential. There is no tenant parameter on any
route here, which is deliberate: usage is the input to a commercial
conversation, and a surface that let an authenticated user name somebody
else's tenant would publish one customer's volume to another.

No pricing. These are counts and measured model costs. What they are worth
belongs nowhere near the code that answers what happened.
