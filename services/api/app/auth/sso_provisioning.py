"""Turn a verified IdP assertion into a local user, a tenant and a real token.

Parity plan 4.1.

What was missing
----------------
Both `saml.py` and `oidc.py` ended a successful sign-in by putting a JWT in
an `aisoc_token` cookie. That token carried `sub`, `email`, `name` and
`picture`, and **no tenant, no role and no local user id**, which is three
problems at once:

* the API's own verifier reads `sub` as a user id and requires `tenant_id`
  and `role`, so the token authenticates nothing;
* it is signed with `JWT_SECRET` rather than `settings.SECRET_KEY`, which
  is a different key from the one the API verifies with;
* it is a cookie, and the API reads `Authorization: Bearer`.

So a user could complete the whole OIDC dance, be redirected to the
console, and find every request unauthenticated. The plan's phrasing is
exact: "a token in a cookie the API never reads, and it names no local
user, tenant or role".

Just-in-time provisioning, and the two things it must not do
-------------------------------------------------------------
On first sign-in the user is created. Two constraints make that safe:

1. **The tenant comes from configuration, never from the assertion.** An
   IdP that can name its own tenant can name somebody else's. The tenant is
   resolved from the SSO connection's own record, which an administrator
   set up.

2. **A group maps to a role only through `app.core.role_grants`.** The same
   path every other grant takes, so an IdP group cannot confer `admin` or
   `platform_admin` any more than an API caller can. An unmapped group
   grants nothing rather than defaulting to something convenient.

    Three steps, in order, and the order is the security property.

    **1. The subject, if this connection has seen it.** `sub` is the stable
    identifier, so a bound account survives its owner changing email address at
    the provider.

    **2. The email, but only if the provider says it verified it.** This used
    to be the only step, with no `email_verified` requirement anywhere in the
    OIDC path -- so an attacker who could authenticate to the tenant's
    configured provider with an account carrying a victim's *unverified*
    address received a token minted for the victim's local id, and with
    database-backed RBAC the API resolved the victim's `user_roles`
    (GHSA-qjjc-q2h2-56cg). A claim that is absent or false is treated as
    unverified, because OIDC makes `email_verified` optional and "the provider
    did not say" is not "the provider said yes".

    Matching on email at all is deliberate and stays: an organisation that
    moves from one identity provider to another keeps its email addresses and
    would otherwise get a second account for every person. The binding is per
    **connection**, so a migration starts with none and everyone re-claims
    their own account on first sign-in -- which is exactly that behaviour.

    **3. Create.** Nobody owns this address yet.

    `email_verified` is `True` for SAML: the assertion is signed by the
    identity provider, and the address it asserts *is* the provider's
    statement about the user. There is no separate claim to consult.
