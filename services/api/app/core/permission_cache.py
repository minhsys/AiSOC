"""One permission model, read from the database, cached per replica.

The problem
-----------
Two permission models shipped side by side. 275 route dependencies called
the **synchronous** `require_permission`, which consults the hardcoded
`ROLE_PERMISSIONS` map in `app/core/security.py`; 27 called the **async**
`require_permission_db`, which consults the `user_roles` /
`role_permissions` tables. The console has a full RBAC administration
surface writing to those tables, so an operator could grant a permission,
watch it appear in the UI, and have 275 of 302 routes ignore it entirely.

The fix is not to edit 275 call sites. It is to make the one factory they
all already call read from the database, which changes every site at once
and leaves no second model to drift.

The fallback, and why its old shape was wrong
---------------------------------------------
`has_permission_db` fell back to the static map whenever a user had no rows
in `user_roles`. That is right for bootstrap — a fresh tenant has no RBAC
configured and must still work — and wrong for deprovisioning: **removing
every role from a user restored their static permissions** rather than
removing their access. The two cases look identical from the user's row
count alone, and the distinguishing fact is one level up: does the *tenant*
have any roles at all?

* tenant has no roles configured → static map (bootstrap, nothing to read)
* tenant has roles, this user has none → **deny** (they were deprovisioned)
* tenant has roles, this user has some → those, and only those

The cache
---------
A permission check on every request would mean a four-table join on every
request. Resolved sets are cached per replica, keyed by
`(tenant_id, user_id, version)`.

`version` is the point. A TTL alone means a revoked permission keeps
working for the length of the TTL on every replica that has it cached,
which for an access revocation is the wrong failure mode. The version is a
per-tenant counter in Redis, bumped whenever a grant changes, so a revoke
invalidates **every** replica on its next request rather than when their
clocks happen to expire.

Without Redis the version is unavailable and the cache falls back to a
short TTL, which is honest about what it can offer: a single-process
deployment is correct either way, and a multi-replica one without Redis
converges within the TTL. That degradation is logged once, not silently.
