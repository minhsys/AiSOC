"""The one place that decides whether a principal may confer authority.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``POST /api/v1/tenants/me/users`` took a ``role`` string from the request body
and wrote it to ``users.role`` — the column ``CurrentUser.require_permission``
reads on every guarded request. ``ROLE_PERMISSIONS`` gives ``platform_admin``
and ``admin`` the list ``["*"]``, and ``has_permission`` returns ``True`` for
every permission when that list contains ``"*"``. So a ``tenant_admin``, whose
whole point is that it is *scoped*, could create an account holding every
permission in the product and sign in as it (GHSA-pm3f-h6gc-rvgp).

The narrow repair is an allow-list on that one handler. It is the wrong
repair, because the defect is not "this handler forgot to validate": it is
that the server treated a client-supplied authority string as the
authorization decision itself. Four other routes did the same thing, and an
allow-list per route means the fifth one written next year is a new advisory.

So the property enforced here is about the *granter*, not the call site:

    no principal may confer authority it does not itself hold.

Escalation is then impossible by construction rather than by enumeration, and
a new route that writes a role gets the property by calling one function.

Where the wildcard fits
-----------------------
A subset check alone would still let a wildcard principal confer a wildcard
role, which is ordinarily unremarkable — administrators appoint
administrators. It is not unremarkable *here*, because every route that could
do it resolves its tenant from the caller's session, so a ``platform_admin``
minted through one is a principal with ``"*"`` over every tenant created
through a single tenant's door. :func:`never_grantable` therefore refuses the
wildcard roles to everyone, including a caller that already holds ``"*"``.
Minting one stays an out-of-band act with database credentials
(``app/scripts/bootstrap_admin.py``).

That set is *derived* from ``ROLE_PERMISSIONS`` rather than written down. A
third wildcard role added later is un-grantable the moment it is declared,
which is the only version of this rule that survives someone else editing the
map.

Relationship to the SCIM vocabulary
-----------------------------------
``app/services/scim/roles.py`` had already reached the same conclusion for
directory groups and kept its own copy of the list. Two lists that agree today
are two lists that disagree later, so it now imports :data:`GRANTABLE_ROLES`
and :data:`NEVER_GRANTABLE` from here and the vocabularies are the same object.
