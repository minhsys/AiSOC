"""The precondition a cross-tenant sweep depends on, asserted instead of assumed.

Three paths in this service read or write across every tenant: the retention
purge, the hunt scheduler's due-hunt sweep, and tenant deletion. All three used
to open with ``SET LOCAL row_security = off``.

That statement only ever worked because the deployment connected as a
superuser. ``migrations/061_runtime_app_role.sql`` moves the services onto a
role with neither ``SUPERUSER`` nor ``BYPASSRLS``, and for such a role Postgres
does not ignore policies when row security is off — it refuses the query::

    ERROR:  query would be affected by row-level security policy for table "alerts"

So the construct flips from "no-op dressed as a control" to "hard failure", and
the cross-tenant reads rest instead on the arm every policy in this schema
already carries::

    USING (tenant_id = current_tenant_id() OR current_tenant_id() IS NULL)

A session that never bound a tenant sees everything. That is deliberate and
documented; ``scripts/check_rls_policy_shape.py`` fails if a policy is added
without the arm, so the schema side cannot drift.

Which leaves exactly one way for a sweep to go quiet: running on a session that
*did* bind a tenant. It would then enumerate one tenant, purge or reschedule
that tenant's rows under whatever configuration it loaded, and report success.
A worker that silently stops seeing data is a worse failure than the bypass
this change closes, so that condition raises here.

This module deliberately imports nothing from ``app.api`` — it is called from
background workers, and ``app.db.rls`` pulls in the FastAPI dependency graph.
