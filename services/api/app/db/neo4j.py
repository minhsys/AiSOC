    This used to be a fixed list of ``CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS`` statements with

    left the deployment running without a guarantee the code assumes. The

    forward-only migrations.

    Non-strict here on purpose: a migration failure must not take the API
    down, because the graph is an enrichment surface and the rest of the
    platform works without it. It is logged at ``error`` rather than
    ``debug``, and the pending list is readable for diagnostics.
