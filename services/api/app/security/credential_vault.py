"""Application-layer encryption for connector credentials.

This module wraps :mod:`cryptography.fernet` to give the rest of the API a
narrow, opinionated interface for storing connector ``auth_config`` payloads
encrypted at rest. The model column itself stays a regular JSONB blob so
operators can query for which tenant owns which connector without having to
decrypt anything; only the field values inside the JSON are ciphertext.

Why Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC-SHA256, plus a versioned token format) rather
than rolling our own AES-GCM:

* Authenticated encryption out of the box — tampering raises
  :class:`InvalidToken`, never a silent partial decrypt.
* Built-in support for **multi-key rotation** via :class:`MultiFernet`. We use
  it so operators can rotate ``AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY`` without a downtime
  migration: new writes use the primary key, old reads still resolve through
  any key listed in ``AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY_ROTATION_FROM``.
* Battle-tested and audited; we'd rather lean on the upstream than ship a
  hand-rolled crypto module in an open-source SOC product.

What the vault deliberately does **not** do:

* It does not derive a key from the user's password. We expect operators to
  generate a key with :func:`cryptography.fernet.Fernet.generate_key` and
  mount it via Fly.io secret / k8s secret / vault. Plaintext keys never
  appear in logs.
* It does not encrypt the *whole* ``auth_config`` blob as a single
  ciphertext. Each leaf string value is encrypted individually so:
    1. structural fields (e.g. region, base URL) stay queryable for ops, and
    2. partial decryption failures don't lose the rest of the row.

The vault is intentionally pure — it does not touch the DB, doesn't take a
``Settings`` instance, and is therefore trivially unit-testable without a
live Postgres or Redis.
