"""Intersect a client-supplied tenant with the authenticated principal's scope.

The API service already resolves an authenticated principal on almost every
route (``AuthUser`` → :class:`~app.api.v1.deps.CurrentUser`), so the tenant is
available without the caller naming it. Some routes still accept a
``tenant_id`` query parameter anyway — for a console that passes it explicitly,
or an MSSP operator narrowing to one managed customer — and that parameter is
where the isolation question lives.

This module is the one place that answers it. The rule is intersection:

* no ``tenant_id`` supplied → the principal's own tenant;
* a ``tenant_id`` the principal holds → that tenant;
* anything else → 403, never the requested tenant's rows.

Several routes already did this inline, correctly, with a hand-written
``if tenant_id != current_user.tenant_id: raise 403``. Correct, but invisible:
a structural gate cannot see it, a reviewer has to notice its absence rather
than its presence, and the next route to be written copies whichever neighbour
it happened to look at. Naming the operation makes the property checkable —
``scripts/check_route_tenant_scope.py`` fails the build when a route takes a
tenant identifier and never passes it through one of these.

Cross-tenant surfaces (the MSSP portfolio) are a different shape and keep
their own resolver, :mod:`app.services.org_scope`, which answers "which
tenants" rather than "which tenant". Both refuse on an empty scope rather than
widening to all — that is the invariant they share, and the one every
cross-tenant leak in this codebase has broken.
