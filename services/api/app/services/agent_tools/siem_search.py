"""Federated SIEM search, shaped for an agent rather than for a console.

Gap-closure Phase 4.1.

This does **not** build a federated search. ``/federated/search`` already
fans a ``UnifiedQuery`` out to every federated-capable connector a tenant has
enabled, decrypting per-tenant credentials from the vault and isolating each
backend's failure so one dead SIEM cannot cancel the answer. That is reused:
``_fetch_target_connectors`` and ``_query_one_backend`` are imported from the
endpoint that owns them, not reimplemented here.

What this adds is the three things an agent needs and a console does not.

**A typed query.** The caller names an indicator type from a closed set and
this resolves the field per backend, so the model never names a field and
never supplies query text. See ``indicators`` for why that is a security
boundary and not a style preference.

**A bounded, projected result.** A console renders every column of every row
and lets a human scroll. A model pays for every token and cannot skim, so
rows are projected to the fields that carry signal, capped in count, and
capped again in serialized size. The caps are reported when they bite, so a
truncated answer is legible as truncated rather than as the whole picture.

**An honest account of what could not be checked.** A backend that errored,
a backend with no field mapping for the indicator type, and a backend that
genuinely holds no matching rows are three different facts. They are kept
apart all the way to the caller, because an agent that reads the first as the
third concludes a host is clean on evidence nobody gathered.

#: loop, and the marginal value of row 40 in answering "has this indicator
#: been seen here" is close to nil. A caller may ask for less, never more.
MAX_ROWS = 40

#: Ceiling on the serialized result, independent of the row count. A row cap
#: alone is not a size cap: one Sentinel row carrying a base64 payload can be
#: larger than forty ordinary ones, and a single tool result that fills the
#: context window ends the investigation as surely as an error would.
MAX_RESULT_BYTES = 24_000

#: Per-backend timeout. Shorter than the console's, because this runs inside a
#: tool loop that has its own wall-clock budget: a pivot that takes 30 seconds
#: has spent a quarter of the investigation's budget on one question.
PER_BACKEND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 12.0

#: Fields worth returning, in the order a reader wants them. Every backend
#: has its own schema, so this is a union across the four rather than a
#: mapping, and a row that carries none of them falls back to its first few
#: keys so a caller is never handed an empty object.
