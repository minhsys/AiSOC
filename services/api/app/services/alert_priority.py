"""Turn severity, asset criticality and identity privilege into a queue order.

Gap-closure wave 11.

`assets.criticality` reached a prompt string and a sort order and
nothing else, so two alerts of equal severity — one on a domain
controller, one on a meeting-room display — arrived in the queue in
the order they were raised. An analyst worked out which was which by
reading the hostname.

The design decision that matters
-----------------------------------
Severity is the **base** and context is a **multiplier**, not a sum.
Addition lets a stack of small contextual bumps push an informational
alert above a critical one, which is how a prioritisation scheme gets
switched off after the first time it surprises somebody. Multiplying
means context can reorder alerts of similar severity — which is what
it is for — and cannot invert a severity gap.

Every factor is bounded and the product is clamped, so no single
signal can dominate. A domain controller is more important than a
laptop; it is not infinitely more important.

Why the rationale travels with the score
-------------------------------------------
An ordering a person cannot interrogate is one they stop trusting.
Every factor that moved the number is recorded with its contribution,
so "why was this top of my queue" has an answer that does not require
re-deriving today's CMDB state — which has changed since.

What this deliberately does not do
-------------------------------------
It does not alter severity. Severity is what the detection claimed and
is compared across deployments; priority is local and says what to
look at first here. Conflating them would make a tenant's CMDB quality
silently change what their detections appear to have found.
