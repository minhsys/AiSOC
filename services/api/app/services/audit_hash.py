"""Tamper-evident hash chain for audit log entries.

The ``audit_log`` table is already write-only (trigger-enforced) and
tenant-isolated (RLS). What that combination does *not* defend against
is a privileged operator with SQL access doing
``TRUNCATE audit_log`` / ``DROP TABLE`` / ``DELETE WHERE …`` (via
``ALTER TABLE … DISABLE TRIGGER ALL``) and replacing the history with a
forgery. The trigger only fires on UPDATE/DELETE through the normal
SQL path; a sufficiently privileged actor can bypass it.

A hash chain closes that gap **without** trusting Postgres. Every audit
row stores:

* ``prev_hash``  — the ``entry_hash`` of the previous audit row for
  the same tenant, or ``None`` for the first row.
* ``entry_hash`` — sha256 over a canonical serialization of this row's
  business fields, mixed with ``prev_hash``.

Anyone — including an external auditor — can replay the chain
deterministically and prove that no row was deleted, reordered, or
silently rewritten. The verification logic is intentionally pure (no
DB access) so it can run on a CSV export as easily as a live row.

The algorithm:

1. Build a stable, sorted-key JSON payload of the fields that define
   the audit event (``tenant_id``, ``actor_id``, ``actor_email``,
   ``actor_ip``, ``action``, ``resource``, ``resource_id``,
   ``changes`` already-redacted, ``metadata``, ``created_at`` in
   ISO-8601, and the row ``id`` itself).
2. Prepend the ``prev_hash`` (or an empty string for the genesis row).
3. ``entry_hash = sha256(payload).hexdigest()``.

The set of hashed fields is deliberately conservative — adding a field
is a chain-breaking change and requires a schema migration. We
explicitly include the row ``id`` because the table assigns one by
default and including it makes the chain agnostic to insertion order
within the same wall-clock microsecond.
