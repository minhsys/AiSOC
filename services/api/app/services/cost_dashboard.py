"""Cost dashboard builder.

WS-H1 — buyer-value plan
========================
Produces a deterministic snapshot of LLM spend, automation activity and
BYOK savings for a tenant over a fixed window (default: last 30 days).

The output backs the admin cost dashboard at
``apps/web/src/app/(admin)/costs/`` and answers:

  * Where is my LLM money going? (daily time-series + per-model breakdown)
  * Which investigations are the most expensive? (top-cost cases)
  * How much SOC activity am I getting for that money? (action counts)
  * Am I saving money by running my own model? (BYOK imputed savings)

Following the WS-G2 pattern, the module splits into:

  1. ``build_dashboard_from_rows`` — a *pure* function that consumes
     pre-fetched rows and emits a ``CostDashboard``. Fully deterministic
     and tested without a database.

  2. ``build_cost_dashboard`` — a thin async orchestrator that runs the
     SQL queries and forwards rows into the pure builder.

Every dollar figure carries its provenance
------------------------------------------
Cost arrives here already classified by the agents service (migration 063):

``measured``
    The LiteLLM gateway reported what the call cost. Real money. A measured
    ``0.0`` — what a local model genuinely costs — is a fact, not a gap.

``estimated``
    Re-priced from a public list price for a **concrete** model id. An
    approximation, and labelled one on every surface, including this one.

``unpriced``
    Neither. Reported as *not measured*.

The counts travel with the sums, so a zero can be told from an absence. This
follows the MTTR precedent in ``api/v1/endpoints/metrics.py``, where a mean
over zero rows shipped as a confident ``0.0`` until its sample count came
with it. Without that, this dashboard could not distinguish "the agents spent
nothing" from "nobody told us what the agents spent", and it rendered the
first — a free AI-SOC, for a tenant nobody had priced.

There is deliberately no field summing measured and estimated together. One
number cannot be labelled two ways, and adding a guess to a measurement is
how the guess stops looking like one.

BYOK savings are *imputed*: we re-price recorded prompt+completion token
pairs against the public list price for the model that handled them. Only
models this table actually knows a price for are imputed at all — there is no
default rate, because a default rate is how the tracker came to invent
$0.000999 for a free local run in the first place. The response carries
``is_byok_active`` plus the number of tokens that could not be priced, so the
UI can say how much of the estimate is missing rather than implying none is.
