"""Elasticsearch event-warehouse provider — Phase 4.5.

A thin shim over :mod:`app.services.esql_runner` so the scheduler can talk
to all warehouses through the same provider interface. The runner stays the
single source of truth for SSRF / air-gap guards + the ``| LIMIT`` row cap.

Credentials come from the tenant's own ``elastic`` connector row, resolved
and vault-decrypted by the caller. The field names read below are exactly
the ones :meth:`ElasticConnector.schema` declares in the connectors
microservice — ``base_url``, ``api_key``, ``username``, ``password`` — so
what the user typed into the console wizard is what the hunt runs against.
