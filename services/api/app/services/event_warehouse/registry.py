"""Provider registry — which warehouse driver runs a given hunt.

Selection rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. If the hunt's :attr:`SavedHunt.warehouse_provider` field is set *and*
   points at a known provider name, that provider is the only one tried.
   This is the per-hunt override surface (the model field will land in a
   follow-up migration; see :func:`_select_provider_name`).
2. Otherwise we walk :data:`SUPPORTED_PROVIDERS` in priority order and pick
   the first provider that can both (a) read a translation out of the
   hunt and (b) take credentials from a connector type the tenant has
   actually enabled.
3. If nothing matches we raise :class:`UnsupportedTranslation`, whose
   message distinguishes "this hunt was never translated" from "you have
   not connected a SIEM we can run it against".

Why rule 2 needs the tenant's connected types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Selection used to consider only the translation. The natural-language
translator emits ES|QL, SPL *and* KQL for every question, so the ``esql``
key was always present and the Elasticsearch driver was always chosen —
including for a tenant whose only SIEM is Splunk. Implementing the Splunk
driver would not have helped on its own, because it could never have been
reached. Selection must be driven by what the tenant connected, and the
translation is the second filter rather than the first.

# on ``Settings``. It could not be selected and could not run, while
# ``available_providers()`` reported it as a supported warehouse. Adding a
# real one is a `register_provider` call plus a UDM translator.
