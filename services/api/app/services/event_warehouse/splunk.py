"""Splunk event-warehouse provider.

Runs the SPL the platform's translator already produced for a saved hunt
against the tenant's own Splunk search head, using the credentials stored
on their ``splunk`` connector row.

This driver previously raised :class:`HuntNotConfigured` unconditionally —
it checked ``settings.SPLUNK_URL`` and ``settings.SPLUNK_HMAC_TOKEN``,
neither of which is a declared field on ``Settings``, and then raised
"scaffolded but live SPL execution not yet shipped" even if they had been.
The SPL translation was produced for every hunt and then discarded.
