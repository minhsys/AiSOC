"""Incident context traversal: one query, five dimensions, tenant-scoped.

An investigation needs to answer five questions about an alert, and until now
each was a separate round trip or was not answerable at all:

    identity  Which person is behind the account, what team, who is their
              manager, are they still employed?
    asset     What host, who owns it, what does it run, what is exploitable
              on it right now?
    cloud     Which account, which workload, what secrets does it reach?
    business  Which business application, how critical, what data class,
              who is accountable?
    threat    Which indicators, which malware family, which campaign, which
              actor, which techniques?

``get_blast_radius`` answers "what is reachable" but not "what does any of it
mean" — it returns a node set, unlabelled by dimension, so a caller has to
re-derive the structure. This returns the five dimensions separately, which
is what a narrative and a prompt both need.

Three properties are load-bearing:

**Tenant scoping on every node of every path.** Not just the start node: an
expansion through a shared entity (a public IP both tenants have seen) is how
a traversal leaves its tenant. Global reference labels — MITRE technique and
tactic vocabulary, public malware and actor intel — are exempt, because
requiring a tenant_id on them makes them unreachable for everyone.

**Bounded fan-out.** Every leg has its own LIMIT. An unbounded traversal from
a busy host is not slow, it is unbounded, and this sits on the hot path of
every escalated alert.

**Partial results are reported as partial.** One dimension failing returns
the other four with the failure named, rather than an empty bundle that reads
as "no context exists" — which is the same output an agent gets for a genuinely
isolated alert, and the two must not be confused.
