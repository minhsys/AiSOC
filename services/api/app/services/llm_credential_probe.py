"""Place one real call with a tenant's BYOK credential, and report what happened.

Why this exists
---------------
`GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /api/v1/llm/credentials` validate *shape*: that the URL
parses, that the provider/key/base-URL combination is internally consistent.
None of them talks to the provider. So an operator who pasted a revoked key,
or pointed at a host that is not running, found out when triage silently fell
back to the deterministic path -- a failure that is quiet by design, which is
precisely what makes it hard to attribute to the key.

The guard, and why it is not the webhook one
--------------------------------------------
This makes an outbound request to a URL the tenant supplied, so it needs an
SSRF guard. The API already has one and it is the wrong shape:
`destinations.py::_guard_url` rejects every private and loopback address
outright. That is correct for a webhook and would refuse `local-ollama`,
`local-vllm` and `local-litellm` -- three of the seven providers migration 038
explicitly allows, and the ones most likely to be on a private address.

`validate_outbound_url(url, allow_private=True)` is the shape that fits: a
private host is permitted while loopback and link-local are still rejected, so
the cloud-metadata endpoint at 169.254.169.254 stays blocked *even though*
private addresses are allowed. Vendored from the agents service and held
byte-identical by `scripts/sync_vendored_ssrf_guard.py`.

Air-gap
-------
Checked before anything is dialled, and reported as `unverified` rather than
as a failure: an air-gapped deployment refusing egress is the posture working,
not a broken credential.
