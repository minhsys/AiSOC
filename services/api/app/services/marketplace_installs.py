"""Which marketplace items a tenant has installed, in Postgres.

Wave 0 of the gap-closure plan.

Install state was a module-level dict guarded by a `threading.Lock`,
under a comment saying it was "intentionally tracked in-memory per
process for now". Two consequences, and the second is the worse one:

* Every install was **lost on restart**, so a tenant's enabled content
  silently reverted on each deploy.
* On more than one replica the answer to "is this installed" depended on
  which replica answered. An operator could install an item, refresh,
  and be told it was not installed — then install it again.

`marketplace_installs` has existed since migration 056, with exactly the
columns needed and a `UNIQUE (tenant_id, item_id)` constraint, and had
no reader or writer anywhere in the repository.

Idempotency
-----------
`ON CONFLICT (tenant_id, item_id) DO UPDATE` rather than a read-then-write.
Two replicas handling a double-click cannot both insert, and the second
refreshes the recorded version instead of failing — which is what the
in-memory path did by re-reading its own dict under a lock, a guarantee
that stopped holding the moment there were two processes.
