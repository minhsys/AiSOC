"""Cross-tenant aggregates over a managed portfolio.

Every function here reads more than one tenant's data on purpose, which
makes this the most dangerous module in the tenancy surface: it is the one
place where "filter by the caller's tenant" is deliberately not the rule.
Three properties keep it honest, and they are structural rather than
conventional because a convention is what the previous cross-tenant leaks
were relying on.

**The scope is a parameter, not a default.** No function reads the request,
the session, or the current user. Each takes a resolved
:class:`~app.services.org_scope.PortfolioScope` and passes it through
:func:`~app.services.org_scope.require_scope`, which raises on an empty
portfolio. An aggregate therefore cannot run with no filter — the failure
mode is an exception, not a table scan.

**The tenant list is bound, never interpolated.** `tenant_id = ANY(:ids)`
with the ids as a parameter. This mirrors the ClickHouse lesson: the moment
a scoping predicate is built by string formatting, its correctness depends
on whoever edits the string next.

**Nothing is invented.** These endpoints previously returned five
hardcoded companies — "Acme Corp, health 92.4, 12 open alerts" — to any
authenticated caller. Where a figure cannot be measured from real rows it
is absent or zero here, and an empty portfolio returns empty results rather
than a sample.
