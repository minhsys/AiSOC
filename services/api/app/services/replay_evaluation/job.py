"""Orchestrate one replay evaluation across three services, then score it.

Gap-closure Phase 1.4.

Why this lives in the API
-------------------------
No process can hold two of these services. ``services/actions`` owns the SIEM
credential path and the history readers; ``services/agents`` owns triage;
``services/connectors`` owns ``normalize()``. All three package their code as
top-level ``app``, so a process that imported two of them would import two
modules called ``app`` and get one of them.

The API is the service that already does this. It holds the vault and the
tenant session, it already proxies ``/cases/{id}/investigate`` to agents, and
it already dispatches live actions to actions. So it reads the history from
actions, hands it to agents for the shadow triage, and scores the result with
the vendored benchmark package, which is the one link in the chain with no
round trip.

The chain, and where each link can fail
---------------------------------------
1. the connector row, tenant-scoped, and its vault-decrypted credentials
2. ``POST {actions}/api/v1/replay/history`` for the closed findings
3. ``POST {agents}/api/v1/replay/run`` for the shadow decisions, which itself
   reaches the connectors service for the production ``normalize()``
4. ``score_replay`` and ``format_replay_report``, in process
5. one write of the report and the decisions behind it

Every failure is terminal and carries its reason onto the row. There is no
partial result: a run that read half a window and scored it would publish a
number over whichever findings happened to arrive, and the report would look
exactly like one that worked.

Determinism
-----------
Nothing here contributes a timestamp, a random value or an unsorted iteration
to the report. The seed and the resample count travel from the request onto
the row and into the renderer's method section, so two runs over the same
history with the deterministic model path produce the same bytes. The wall
clock appears only in ``created_at`` / ``started_at`` / ``completed_at``, which
are columns rather than report content.
