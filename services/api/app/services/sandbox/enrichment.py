"""File-hash enrichment: what a sandbox adds to an alert or a submission.

This is the hash-lookup half of the provider contract, shaped for the callers
that have a digest and want to know whether it is worth caring about. It never
uploads: enrichment runs unattended on whatever arrives, and an unattended path
that could upload is one misconfiguration away from disclosing every attachment
a tenant receives.

The output shape mirrors the enrichment service's, so a caller merging this
into an alert's ``enrichments`` does not learn a second schema. The key is
``file_analysis`` rather than a provider name, for the same reason the
interface owns the vocabulary: the reader should not have to know which sandbox
answered.
