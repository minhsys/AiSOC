"""The vocabulary every file and URL analysis provider is translated into.

Why a vocabulary and not a payload
----------------------------------
A sandbox report is the most vendor-shaped object in this product. One vendor
calls its judgement ``verdict``, another ``score``, another ``malscore``; one
returns ATT&CK under ``ttps``, another under ``attackTechniques``, another not
at all. Passing any one of those through to the console and to the agent makes
the first provider wired the de-facto interface, and the second adapter then
gets written to imitate it.

So the interface owns the words. A verdict, a score, signatures, IOCs and an
ATT&CK mapping are what a caller may ask for, and each provider maps its own
payload onto them. Nothing here is named after a vendor, and nothing here
exists because one vendor happened to return it.

Absent is not zero
------------------
The rule that makes this usable is :data:`UNAVAILABLE`. Three states have to
stay distinguishable and two of them look identical if the type is a list:

``[]`` / ``0``
    The provider computed this and the answer is none. The sample contacted no
    domains.
:data:`UNAVAILABLE`
    The provider does not compute this, or the stage that would have computed
    it did not run. Nothing is known either way.
``None`` on an optional field
    Reserved for "this provider has no such concept at all".

Collapsing the middle one into the first is how a sandbox report turns into a
clean bill of health for a sample nobody detonated. A concrete instance is in
the tree: the first commercial adapter returns an empty ATT&CK list alongside
``behavior.analyzed = false``, because the file type could not be identified
and no guest was ever chosen. The techniques are absent because the stage did
not run, and reporting that as "no techniques" would be an invented negative.
