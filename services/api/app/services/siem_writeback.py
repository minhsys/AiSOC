"""Close the loop: project an AiSOC verdict onto the finding that raised it.

Two-way integration has only ever run inbound. A Splunk notable becomes an
AiSOC alert, the agent triages it, and the notable sits in the Splunk queue
untouched — so an analyst re-reads a finding AiSOC already dismissed, and a
finding AiSOC confirmed waits its turn behind them. This service is the
return leg.

Why it lives in the API service
-------------------------------
The agents worker reaches it over HTTP rather than dispatching itself. The
API holds the credential vault, the tenant-scoped database session and the
actions-service token, and it is the single governed path a response action
takes. Duplicating that in the worker would mean two places that can execute
against a customer's SIEM, two audit trails, and two copies of the
credential-handling code — and the second copy is the one that goes stale.

Governance
----------
``AISOC_SIEM_WRITEBACK_ENABLED`` (default **on**) turns the feature off
entirely. ``AISOC_SIEM_WRITEBACK_EXECUTE`` (default **off**) is what decides
whether a vendor is actually called: with it off every attempt is dispatched
as a dry run, recorded with ``executed=False``, and reported as
``mode="dry_run"``. An operator opts in to writing into their own SIEM; they
do not opt out.

Nothing here raises. A writeback failure must never fail the triage that
produced the verdict — the verdict is the durable thing, and losing it
because Splunk was unreachable would be the wrong trade.
