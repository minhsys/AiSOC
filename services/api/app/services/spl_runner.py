"""Splunk SPL executor for the event-warehouse tier.

Sibling of :mod:`app.services.esql_runner`, and deliberately the same
shape: validate the target against an allow-list, enforce the air-gap
policy, cap the row count, then make exactly one outbound call and wrap
every failure in one exception type.

Why the API service runs this rather than `services/connectors`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The credential vault lives in the API service, and `esql_runner` already
established that the warehouse tier executes here. Introducing a second
topology for the Splunk driver in the same change would make the diff
harder to review than the defect it fixes. The connectors microservice
remains the home of *polling* and of federated `UnifiedQuery` fan-out; this
module runs an already-translated dialect string for a scheduled hunt.

Splunk specifics worth stating once
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The management port is 8089, not the 8000 web UI. The connector schema
  says so in its help text; users still paste the web URL, so a connection
  failure names the port.
* ``POST /services/search/jobs`` requires the search string to begin with
  ``search`` or with a generating ``|`` command. The platform's translator
  emits ``index=* earliest=-24h ... | head 500``, which begins with neither,
  so the leading ``search`` is added here. Without it Splunk answers 400 on
  every hunt.
* ``exec_mode=oneshot`` returns results on the same request. A scheduled
  hunt only needs a hit count, so there is no reason to create a job, poll
  it, and page through results the way the polling connector does.
