"""Tenant offboarding: erase one tenant from every store that holds its data.

There was no deletion path. ``DELETE FROM tenants`` relies on foreign-key
cascade, and 14 of the 72 tenant-scoped tables never declared one — including
``aisoc_institutional_memory`` (an offboarded customer's behavioural priors),
``aisoc_compliance_evidence`` and ``aisoc_kb_documents``. Those rows outlive
the tenant silently, which is a deletion-request problem rather than an
untidiness problem. The lake, graph and vector stores had no deletion path at
all.

Two design choices carry most of the value here.

**The Postgres table list is discovered at runtime**, from
``information_schema``, rather than being a constant someone must remember to
extend. A hardcoded list is correct on the day it is written and wrong at the
next migration, and the failure is invisible: deletion reports success while
leaving rows behind. Discovery means a new tenant-scoped table is covered the
moment it exists.

**Every store reports independently.** A tenant is only erased when all of
them succeeded, so a Neo4j outage cannot produce a "deleted" result while the
graph still holds the estate. The caller gets per-store counts and errors, and
``DeletionReport.complete`` is false if anything failed.

Deletion is irreversible and cross-tenant by nature, so the caller is
responsible for authorisation. ``dry_run=True`` (the default) counts without
deleting, because the first question anyone asks is "what exactly will this
remove".
