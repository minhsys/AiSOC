"""Storage and lifecycle for tenant skills: draft, backtested, active, retired.

Gap-closure Phase 6.2.

The lifecycle is the point of this module, and the two rules that make it
worth having are both refusals.

**An edit un-backtests the skill.** Saving new text bumps the version and
drops the row back to ``draft``, discarding the attached reports. A backtest
is a statement about a specific body of text, and carrying it forward across
an edit is how a report comes to describe something nobody is running. The
cost is that an author who fixes a typo runs the backtest again; that is the
correct cost.

**Activation requires a backtest of the exact version being activated**, and
requires both halves of it, the baseline and the candidate. The plan asks for
"before and after metrics side by side", and a candidate score with no
baseline is a number rather than a comparison. The database constraint says
the same thing, so neither this module nor a later one can be the only place
the rule lives.

What a backtest is here
-----------------------
Two Phase 1 replay evaluations over the same history window: one with the
tenant's active skills as they are, one with this skill added. Nothing in this
phase re-implements replay, scoring or reporting. ``services/api/app/services/
replay_evaluation/job.py`` runs both, and this module records which two runs
belong to which skill version.
