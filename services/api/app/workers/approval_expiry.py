"""Expire approvals nobody answered (deferral 9b).

Phase 9's live-router half landed: a decision on `/approvals/{id}/decide`
carries through to `services/actions` and the row records whether it
executed. The durable timer table landed too, in `062_approval_timers.sql`.

What was left is every approval the bot never sees. The expiry lives in
`services/slack-bot`, a `chatops`-profile service, and is armed per ChatOps
approval. The API's own `agent_approvals` row carries an `expires_at` and its
status vocabulary includes `expired` — and **nothing wrote that status and no
worker swept the column**. An approval raised in the console and never
answered waited forever rather than timing out to its declared safe default.

Forever is the wrong default for a pending containment. It is also the
*invisible* wrong default: the row stays `pending`, the queue keeps showing
it, and nobody can tell a request still being considered from one abandoned
three weeks ago.

The safe default, and where it comes from
-----------------------------------------
`rejected`. Not invented here — it is what `services/slack-bot` has always
used (`SafeDefault = Literal["rejected", "approved"]` defaulting to
`"rejected"`, and `safe_default TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'rejected'` in
migration 062), stated there as "so a forgotten approval can never
accidentally execute". This worker expires to the same default the other half
of the system already declares, because two halves timing out two different
ways would be worse than either.

Expiring is not deciding
------------------------
An expired approval is marked `expired`, and **nothing is dispatched**. The
`/decide` endpoint deliberately still accepts an `expired` row — its guard is
`status not in {"pending", "expired"}` — so a human who returns to a timed-out
request can still act on it. Timing out removes the pretence that the request
is live; it does not spend the decision on the operator's behalf.

Only rows that opted in
-----------------------
`expires_at` is nullable and only `POST /approvals` ever writes it, from a
caller-supplied value. Rows without one are left alone rather than given a
default window here: inventing a deadline for an approval whose creator did
not set one would start expiring containments on a schedule nobody chose.
That gap is reported in the run summary rather than silently closed, so the
number of never-expiring approvals is visible instead of assumed to be zero.
