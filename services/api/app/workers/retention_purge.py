"""Retention purge worker — the thing that makes a retention policy do something.

``app.services.retention`` has built correct, bounded, tenant-scoped purge SQL
since Wave 5, and its docstring says "the scheduler/worker that runs the purge
composes these". No such worker existed. ``build_lake_purge_sql`` and
``build_alert_purge_sql`` had exactly one caller each — the test asserting they
were well-formed. A tenant could configure retention in the UI, see it persist,
watch the claim-to-gate matrix call it GATED, and never lose a row.

Design notes that matter more than the code:

**Default off.** Turning a release upgrade into unannounced data deletion is
not acceptable, so ``RETENTION_WORKER_ENABLED`` defaults to false and the
worker logs loudly what it would do. Operators opt in.

**Dry-run first.** ``RETENTION_WORKER_DRY_RUN`` (default true when the worker
is first enabled) counts rows instead of deleting them, so an operator can see
the blast radius before arming it. The counts are logged and returned, so the
same code path proves the predicate is right.

**Only explicit policies.** The worker purges for tenants that have a
``retention_policies`` row. It deliberately does *not* apply
``DEFAULT_RETENTION`` to tenants that never configured anything: those defaults
exist to pre-fill a form, and treating them as an instruction would delete data
nobody asked to delete.

**Audit is excluded.** ``audit_days`` is storable but not purged here. The
audit log is an append-only hash chain (migration 043) whose entire value is
that no row was deleted, reordered, or rewritten; a retention purge would break
the chain and make every subsequent verification fail. Enforcing an audit
retention window needs chain-aware truncation with a re-anchored checkpoint,
which is a different piece of work. Saying so in one place beats a purge that
silently errors every tick.
