"""The consumer for ``NEW_IOC``, which nothing had.

Gap-closure Phase 8.1.

``services/threatintel/app/feeds/pipeline.py`` has emitted a ``NEW_IOC``
event for every newly-seen indicator since the pipeline was written, and a
grep for the string across this repository returns the emit site and nothing
else. This module is the other end.

Two things about the topic, because both are the kind of mistake that reports
success while doing nothing:

**The topic name in the pipeline's signature is not the topic in use.**
``ThreatIntelPipeline.__init__`` defaults ``kafka_topic`` to
``threat-intel-events``, and ``services/threatintel``'s lifespan passes
``settings.KAFKA_TOPIC_THREAT_INTEL``, which is ``aisoc.threat_intel``. The
constructor default is therefore unreachable in any running deployment. A
consumer written against it would subscribe to a topic no producer writes,
consume nothing, log nothing, and keep a container healthy indefinitely.
``scripts/check_ioc_lake_mapping.py`` compares the two settings so they cannot
drift apart again.

**A consumer that cannot reach its topic must say which kind of problem it
has.** The rule this service already follows elsewhere: a transient fault
retries with backoff, a permanent one stops the loop and names the operator
action, and a poison message is skipped without penalising a working
subscription. The failure that motivated the rule was a consumer with no
``except`` at all, which exited its ``async for`` and left the container
``running`` with ``/health`` answering 200 while it was subscribed to nothing.

The work itself is deliberately not done here. This module owns the
subscription, the decode, the routing decision and the per-tenant fan-out;
:mod:`app.services.retro_hunt.service` owns what a sweep is worth doing and
what it opens. That split is what lets the sweep be tested without a broker.
