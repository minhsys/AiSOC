"""A tenant who worked their queue to zero sees zero, not their whole history.

The defect
----------
`GET /api/v1/metrics/dashboard` counted alerts like this:

    total_q    = count(where tenant_id = ...)
    critical_q = count(where tenant_id = ... and severity = 'critical')

No status filter on either. The console renders the first as **Active Alerts**
and the second under **Critical — Require immediate action**, so both numbers
were the tenant's entire historical intake. They never went down. A tenant who
had triaged and resolved every alert still saw a red critical tile demanding
immediate action on work finished months ago.

The filter was not missing for want of a definition -- `alerts.py:710`,
`metrics.py:1018` and `health.py:416` all already carried
`status.in_(("new", "triaging", "in_progress"))`. The tile was simply the one
site that never got it, which is why the fix routes them through
`app.services.alert_status` rather than adding a fifth hand-written copy.

Run against live Postgres, because the defect is a missing `WHERE` clause and
a fake session that answers any query cannot tell a filtered count from an
unfiltered one. Skips when no database answers so a local run stays green, but
**cannot** skip where it is meant to run: `integration.yml` sets
`MSSP_ISOLATION_REQUIRED=1` and an unreachable database is then a failure --
a gate that quietly declines to run is the shape this file exists to catch.
