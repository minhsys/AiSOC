"""The four per-framework compliance routes exist, and nothing shadows them.

`apps/web/src/components/compliance/` made eight calls to four route shapes
that did not exist, so `/compliance/[framework]` and `/compliance/soc2` were
pages that could never load. The console also sends slugs (`soc2`) while
`FRAMEWORKS` is keyed `SOC2`, so both halves had to be wrong for the page to
be this broken and fixing one would have left a 404 behind the other.

The shadowing case is the one worth a test rather than a glance. A path
parameter compiles to `[^/]+`, so `/{framework}` will swallow the sibling
literals `/frameworks`, `/evidence` and `/report` if it is mounted first.
That exact defect has shipped in this tree before, on `/hunts/{hunt_id}`
against `/runs` and `/findings`, and the fix there was a path convertor
because declaration order is a convention a later edit can undo.

Here the ordering is what prevents it, so this asserts the **outcome**:
which handler a request actually reaches, read from the router rather than
inferred from the source.
