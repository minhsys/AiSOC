"""One permission model, and the database is authoritative.

Two models shipped side by side. 275 route dependencies called the
synchronous `require_permission`, which reads the hardcoded
`ROLE_PERMISSIONS` map; 27 called `require_permission_db`, which reads the
`user_roles` / `role_permissions` tables. The console ships a full RBAC
administration surface writing to those tables — so an operator could grant
a permission, watch it appear in the UI, and have **275 of 302 routes
ignore it**.

Tested in both directions, which is the only way this means anything:

* a permission the database grants and the static map does not must be
  **allowed** — otherwise the RBAC screen is decorative;
* a permission the static map grants and the database does not must be
  **denied** — otherwise revoking access does nothing.

The second is the one that was broken in a subtle way. `has_permission_db`
fell back to the static map whenever a user had no rows in `user_roles`,
which is right for a fresh tenant and wrong for a deprovisioned user:
**removing every role restored their static permissions.** The two cases
are indistinguishable from the user's row count alone, so the resolver asks
one level up — does the *tenant* have any roles at all?
