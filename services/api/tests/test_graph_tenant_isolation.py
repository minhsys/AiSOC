"""Graph reads must be scoped to the querying tenant.

Two real cross-tenant leaks lived here.

`get_entity_neighbors` accepted a `tenant_id` argument and never used it. The
Cypher had no tenant predicate and the parameter was not even passed to the
driver, so any authenticated user could read any other tenant's host, user or
IOC node plus all of its neighbours — with full node properties — just by
naming the id.

`get_blast_radius` filtered only the traversal's *start* node, and accepted
`tenant_id IS NULL`. The APOC expansion could therefore leave the tenant's
estate through a shared entity such as a public IP and enumerate another
tenant's hosts and users. Blast radius is exactly the query an attacker would
want for reconnaissance.

These tests assert the shape of the query and, critically, that `tenant_id` is
bound at all. The original bug was not a subtly wrong predicate; it was a
parameter that never reached the database, which is why a review reading the
function signature saw a tenant-scoped API.
