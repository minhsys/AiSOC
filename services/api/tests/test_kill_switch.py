"""The kill switch is reachable, authorized and audited.

Parity plan 2.2. The agents-side half (that an engaged switch actually stops
closure) lives in `services/agents/tests/test_closure_policy.py`, which
drives the resolver. This covers the API surface: that the routes exist,
that writing requires a permission while reading does not, and that the
reason is mandatory.
