"""The API-token minter creates nothing and never mints for the demo tenant.

`make smoke` drives one real event through the pipeline and then asks the API
whether it became an alert. That read used to succeed with no credential,
because an uncredentialed request resolved to a demo administrator in a
development-class environment and every documented way to start the stack
produced one. So the golden pipeline was reading the API as an anonymous
administrator, without anybody having decided that.

This command is how the harness gets a real credential instead. Two properties
matter more than the happy path:

* it mints for an account that already exists and refuses otherwise, because a
  minting command that could create its own administrator would be a second
  bootstrap path with none of the checks the first one has;
* it never mints for the demo tenant, because that tenant is what the
  development auth shim hands an anonymous caller — a real token scoped to it
  would make the bypass reachable from outside the bypass.
