"""Live-Postgres proof that a portfolio aggregate cannot see outside itself.

The MSSP surface deliberately reads more than one tenant's rows, which makes
it the one place in the product where "filter by the caller's tenant" is not
the rule. That is worth a gate that runs against a real database rather than
a mocked session, for the reason the cross-store suite exists at all: an
isolation contract that is only unit-tested against a mock is a claim, not a
gate.

Shape of every test here, borrowed from `tests/isolation/test_live_stores.py`
because it is what makes such a test meaningful:

1. Seed a managed portfolio *and* data belonging to tenants outside it.
2. Assert the outside data really exists, so a scoped read returning
   nothing cannot pass vacuously on an empty database.
3. Assert the scoped read returns the portfolio and never the outsiders.

Two of these also stand as regression tests against what this surface used
to do. `/mssp/tenants` returned five hardcoded companies — Acme Corp, Globex
Industries, Wayne Enterprises — with invented alert counts and health
scores. `test_every_returned_tenant_exists_in_the_database` fails against
that code, because none of those names is a row.

Skips when no database answers, so a local `pytest` run stays green — but
**cannot** skip where it is supposed to run. `integration.yml` sets
`MSSP_ISOLATION_REQUIRED=1`, and an unreachable database is then a failure
rather than a skip. A gate that quietly declines to run is the shape that
left the public scoreboard ten weeks stale while its page promised weekly
rows; checking the DSN *string* is not the same as checking that a database
is there, and `ci.yml` sets a placeholder DSN with no server behind it.
