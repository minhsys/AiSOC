"""A first-run tenant gets a wizard, and sample data that proves something.

The gap
-------
A brand-new operator signed in and landed on `/dashboard`: every tile
zero, every panel an honest empty state, and nothing saying what to do
next. The empty states were correct — that work was already done — but
correct and *useful* are different things, and "0 connected sources" is
not a button.

Two properties this file exists to protect
-------------------------------------------
**Sample data must not mark setup complete.** Somebody who has only
looked at samples still has nothing connected, and a checklist that
congratulates them is the flattering fiction this product spends most of
its effort avoiding.

**Sample data must go through the real pipeline.** Inserting rows would
be easier and would prove nothing: a console full of seeded alerts looks
identical whether ingest, fusion and triage work or are completely
broken. Running the real path means a first-run operator who sees alerts
has also seen the product work.
