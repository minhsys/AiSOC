"""Every pivot the Investigation Rail emits must resolve to a real console route.

``test_alert_rail.py`` already pins the pivot strings, with a docstring saying
the pin "prevents an accidental rename". It cannot: it compares the producer
against a copy of itself. For months it asserted ``/attack-graph?entity=…``
while ``apps/web`` defined no ``attack-graph`` route at all, so every entity
chip in the rail 404'd — and the pin reported OK the whole time, because
nothing ever compared the emitted path against the routes that exist.

This gate closes that direction. It derives the route table from the Next.js
app directory on disk and checks it against what ``build_related_entities``
*actually returns* for a fully-populated alert, rather than against a regex
over the producer's source. A pivot that stops resolving fails here whether
the producer moved or the route did.
