"""Posture, compliance, reporting and platform-config writes authorize now.

Sixteen routes across six modules resolved a session and then checked no
entitlement. The two worth naming:

`POST /posture/findings/{id}/suppress` stands a cloud misconfiguration down
with a reason of the caller's choosing. It is the CSPM equivalent of the
pre-approval GHSA-wj5c-88hg-5926 let a `viewer` install: a read-only account
could suppress every finding in the tenant one id at a time and the dashboard
would go green.

`POST /compliance/evidence/{id}/review` sets the `status` an auditor relies
on, on a hash-chained evidence item. Ungated, a read-only account could append
to the chain and accept its own entries.

Compliance takes two different permissions on purpose: `reports:write` to
collect, `settings:write` to review, so a `soc_lead` can produce evidence and
cannot accept it. That is a role-level separation rather than the person-level
separation `services/actions` enforces on response approvals, and the reason
is a schema fact — migration 013's `aisoc_compliance_evidence` records
`reviewed_by` and no collector, so there is nobody to compare an approver
against. `test_the_role_level_separation_is_real` asserts the split; the
person-level check is not claimed anywhere.

`POST /kb/query` is deliberately left ungated and
`test_kb_query_is_deliberately_not_gated` records that as an assertion rather
than a comment, so flipping it needs a decision and an edit here.
