"""The API hop a playbook step takes to reach governed dispatch.

This module decides two things and no more: which vendor, and which
credentials. Everything about whether the verb may run belongs to
``services/actions``, so the tests here are mostly about the answers this
layer gives when it *cannot* dispatch — because those are the answers that
used to be a silent simulation.

The load-bearing assertion in almost every case is ``executed``. It is the
single field that means a vendor was touched, and every path that did not
touch one has to say so and say which path it was.
