"""The README's API-docs URL has to be the one the app serves.

The quick start told a new user to open `http://localhost:8000/docs`. FastAPI
is mounted with `docs_url="/api/docs"`, so that URL returned
`{"detail":"Not Found"}` on a freshly-started stack — the second link in the
quick start, 404 on arrival.

Pinned as a test rather than fixed once because the two live in different
files and neither mentions the other.
