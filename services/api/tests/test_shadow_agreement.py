"""Rolling agreement, as the console asks for it.

Gap-closure Phase 2.2.

Two things are worth testing here and they are not the arithmetic, which lives
in the shared rules module and is tested there against the same file this
service vendors.

The first is that a scope cannot widen past the tenant. ``scope_kind`` and
``scope_key`` arrive from a query string, and the shape of this feature -
"show me agreement for one alert class" - is exactly the shape that invites a
column name to be interpolated into a statement. The dimension is looked up in
a fixed table and the key is bound, and both halves are asserted.

The second is that reconciliation never guesses a label. ``alerts.disposition``
holds whatever the closing path wrote, and only four values are gradeable.
Everything else has to become ``unlabeled``, which is counted as resolved and
excluded from every rate. Guessing here would manufacture agreement out of an
analyst's shrug, and it would do it silently and in the flattering direction.

There is no Postgres in this suite. The session is mocked, so what is proven
is the statement that gets built and the parameters bound to it; whether
Postgres evaluates that statement as read is what the isolation suite covers.
