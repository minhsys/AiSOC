"""Every store that holds schema must have a way to change it.

`clickhouse/001_init.sql` is four `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements
and zero `ALTER TABLE`; `lake_writer` self-heals with the same idiom. Both
are no-ops once the table exists, so a new column lands on a fresh
deployment and silently does not land on an existing one — and nothing
notices until a query selects a column that is not there, long after the
deploy that was meant to add it.

The tests are mostly about the properties that make a runner trustworthy
rather than about any individual migration: ids never move, a failure stops
the run, and the ledger is read from the store being migrated rather than
somewhere that can drift from it.
