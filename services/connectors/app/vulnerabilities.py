"""Materialise scanner findings as vulnerability rows.

Fix pass item 5.2. See `plans/aisoc_fix_pass_plan.plan.md`.

Why this lives in the connectors service
----------------------------------------
`asset_vulnerabilities` had exactly one writer in the tree: a route a human
calls by hand. The Tenable connector modelled its findings as alerts, so the
table stayed empty on every deployment whose vulnerability data came from a
scanner -- and `_tenant_has_vulnerability_data` in the API's `kev_exposure`
exists precisely to tell "you are not exposed" apart from "nobody has told me
what you run". KEV exposure therefore answered *no data*, forever.

The obvious fix is for the connector to POST to the API, and it is the wrong
one: the service principal is a deliberately read-only credential whose own
docstring says "anything that changes state at a vendor or in the database is
absent on purpose". Granting it a write verb to close this would undo that
decision for every route at once.

This service already owns a database engine (it decrypts connector credentials
at poll time) and already holds the tenant id the scheduler is polling for. So
the write happens here, under the tenant it was polled for, with no new
credential and no widened principal.

Matching, and why there is no ON CONFLICT
-----------------------------------------
Neither `assets` nor `asset_vulnerabilities` carries a natural unique key, so
there is nothing to conflict on. Matching is explicit: an asset by
`(tenant_id, name)` and a finding by `(tenant_id, asset_id, cve_id, source)`.
A re-poll moves `last_found` and leaves `first_found` alone, because "when did
we first see this" is the question an exposure window is asked.
