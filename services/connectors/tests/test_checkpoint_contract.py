"""Ingest checkpoints are a declared contract, not a duck type (10b).

The durable half shipped already: `record_checkpoint` persists a cursor, and
the scheduler advances it only after ingest accepted the batch. What was
missing was adoption — `splunk` was the only one of 84 connectors
implementing it, and the scheduler reached it through
`getattr(connector, "set_checkpoint", None)`, which on the other 83 was
simply absent.

That is the shape worth testing against. A duck-typed optional protocol has
no failing state, only a quiet one: the seed no-opped at `logger.debug` and
nothing could report which connectors resumed and which re-read their
overlap window. So these tests hold two things — the machinery is correct,
and the *count* of adopters is visible rather than assumed.
