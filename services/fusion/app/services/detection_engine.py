"""Live detection-evaluation engine (Phase A2).

The reality audit's second SIEM gap: ~939 executable detection rules existed
but only ran in CI fixture-replay — **nothing evaluated them against the live
event stream**, so telemetry that wasn't a vendor-asserted finding (the
promoter's job) never became an alert.

This engine closes that. It loads the exported native ruleset
(``app/data/detection_ruleset.json``, produced by
``scripts/export_detection_ruleset.py``) and evaluates each ingested event's
recovered raw fields against every relevant rule's ``match_when`` (via the
vendored :func:`app.services.detection_matcher.matches`). A match becomes a
:class:`DetectionHit` that the fusion consumer turns into a ``RawAlert`` and
routes through the normal dedup/correlate/persist pipeline.

Field alignment (verified against the normalizer): the ingest pipeline
preserves the connector-normalized flat event under ``ocsf_event["raw_data"]``
as a JSON string. The native ``match_when`` specs were authored against exactly
those flat connector fields, so ``matches(rule.match_when, json.loads(raw_data))``
is the correct evaluation contract.

Performance: rules are indexed by ``product`` so an event only evaluates its
own product's rules plus product-agnostic rules, keeping per-event work far
below the full 817-rule corpus. The engine is pure/synchronous; the consumer
calls it inline (the corpus is small and the matcher is regex/dict work).

        `raw_data` carries the connector's own normalized dict, and connectors
        put the untouched vendor payload under `raw_event`. The matcher does a
        plain `event.get(field)` with no path traversal, so a rule naming a
        vendor field — `request_uri`, `target_image`, `call_trace` — read
        `None` and could never fire, however correct the rule was.

        The scale of that was not obvious: 663 of the 825 loaded rules
        referenced at least one field that was not visible, and fixture replay
        could not catch any of them because fixtures are synthesized from the
        rule rather than from real telemetry.

        The workaround in use was per-field hoisting inside individual
        connectors, e.g. in `llm_usage.normalize()`:

            # Emit the dotted event_type at the TOP LEVEL so the llm-*
            # detection rules (which match on `event_type`) fire

        which only ever fixed the one field someone noticed. Merging the nested
        payload once, here, fixes the class.

        Connector-normalized keys win on collision. The connector has already
        made a deliberate decision about `severity` or `title`, and a vendor
        field of the same name must not silently override it.
