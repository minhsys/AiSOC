"""Match a fused alert's indicators against the tenant's own IOC store.

Parity plan 3.1: "Match the indicators on fused alerts against the tenant's
IOC store inside fusion, with IOC expiry and decay."

Why inside fusion
-----------------
`AlertEnricher` already extracts indicators and asks the **enrichment
service** about them. That service runs in the `full` profile, so on a CORE
install `enrich()` catches a connection error, logs at `debug` and returns
`{}`. The investigation agent then receives "could not check" for every
indicator on every alert, which is the first thing the capability review
found: the default install gives the agent almost nothing to reason with.

The tenant's own IOC store is different. `threat_intel_iocs` lives in the
same Postgres every CORE service already connects to, and CORE ships a real
CISA KEV feed, so there is genuinely something to match against on a first
run. Reading it directly needs no extra service.

Expiry and decay
----------------
An indicator is not true forever, and treating a two-year-old commodity
hash with the weight of a fresh one is how a stale feed produces confident
nonsense.

* **Expiry** is a hard gate: past `expires_at`, or `is_active = false`, or
  `false_positive = true`, the row does not match at all.
* **Decay** is a multiplier on confidence derived from `last_seen`, with a
  per-type half-life. An IP changes hands in weeks; a malware hash does
  not. Decayed confidence below the floor is reported as a match with low
  confidence rather than dropped, because "we have seen this, weakly" is
  different information from "we have never seen this".

Both are reported alongside the match, so a reader can tell a strong hit
from a faded one rather than seeing one number.
