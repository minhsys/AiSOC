"""Per-tenant detection tuning, loaded into fusion as a versioned overlay.

Parity plan 5.4: "Fusion loads static JSON and never reads tenant tuning.
Load per-tenant suppressions, thresholds, disables, custom rules and MSSP
rule packs into fusion as versioned overlays with hot reload. A tuning
change applies to that tenant only and is recorded with its author and
reason."

What was wrong
--------------
`DetectionEngine` loads `app/data/detection_ruleset.json` at construction
and evaluates every rule against every event. The console lets a tenant
disable a rule, raise its threshold or suppress it for a field value, and
all of that is written to `detection_rules` in Postgres where **the
streaming engine never looks**. A tenant who turned a noisy rule off kept
getting alerts from it, and the console showed the rule as disabled.

Why an overlay rather than a per-tenant ruleset
------------------------------------------------
Building a full ruleset per tenant would mean holding N copies of 833
rules and rebuilding one whenever anybody edits anything. The overlay is
the *difference*: a small set of disables, thresholds and suppressions
applied over the shared corpus at match time. One corpus, one small
per-tenant delta.

Versioning and hot reload
-------------------------
Each tenant's overlay carries a version derived from the rows it was built
from. The engine refetches on a short interval and swaps atomically, so a
tuning change applies within one reload rather than at the next restart.
A reload that fails keeps the previous overlay rather than falling back to
"no tuning": losing a tenant's suppressions because the database blinked
would turn their queue back on.
