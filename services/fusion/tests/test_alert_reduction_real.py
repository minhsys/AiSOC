"""Alert reduction, measured against the correlation logic that actually runs.

The existing measurement in `services/agents/tests/test_alert_reduction.py`
is honest about being synthetic and has always carried a PARTIAL row saying
it "gates an in-test fusion re-impl, not `services/fusion`". Reading it
closely, the gap is wider than that wording suggests: the test does not
merely reimplement fusion's grouping, it implements **different** grouping.

Its docstring describes four tiers keyed on `(rule_id, host, user)` with
10/30/5-minute windows. `RawAlert.correlation_key()` — the method
`Correlator` actually calls — keys on `{tenant}:{entity}:{tactic}`, where
entity is the first of src_ip, hostname, username, domain. Different
dimensions, different windows, different answer. The published
alert-reduction figure therefore described an algorithm the product does
not run.

This measures the real one. `Correlator` itself needs Redis, but Redis is
where it *stores* incidents — the grouping decision is entirely
`correlation_key()` plus the configured window, so the ratio can be
computed from the real method without the storage layer.

The number this produces is a property of a synthetic workload and is
labelled as such, exactly as the original was. What changes is that it is
now a property of *our* algorithm.
