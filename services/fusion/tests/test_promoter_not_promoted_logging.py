"""A non-promoted event must leave a thread to pull, at bounded cost.

The gap: ``promote_normalized_event`` returned ``None`` and the consumer
incremented ``_METRICS["not_promoted"]``. The aggregate reached ``/metrics``,
so an operator could see that events were being dropped — and nothing else.
Not which connector, not what shape, not why. "I connected my SIEM and no
alerts appeared" is the single most likely question a new user asks, and a
counter cannot answer it.

Two properties are asserted here, and they pull against each other, which is
the whole design problem:

* the explanation is **useful** — it names the connector, the OCSF class and
  category, the severity, and which promotion condition was not met;
* the explanation is **bounded** — this is the hot path, and on a normal
  tenant most ingested telemetry is correctly not promoted, so a line per
  event would be the highest-volume log in the platform.
