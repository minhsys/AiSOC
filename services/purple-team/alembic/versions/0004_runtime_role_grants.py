"""Give the runtime role DML on the purple-team tables, and nothing more.

Revision ID: 0004
Revises: 0003
Create Date: 2026-09-24

Companion to ``services/api/migrations/061_runtime_app_role.sql``, which split
one superuser credential into an owner that applies DDL and ``aisoc_app``, the
DML-only role every service's ``DATABASE_URL`` points at. That migration
granted ``aisoc_app`` on ``ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public`` as they stood when it
ran, and set ``ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`` for objects the *same* role creates
afterwards.

Neither clause reaches this chain reliably:

* nothing orders the two chains against each other, so this service's tables
  may not exist when 061's ``ALL TABLES`` grant runs;
* ``ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`` is recorded against the role that issued it, so
  a deployment applying the API chain and this one under different owners — or
  pointing this service at its own database, which ``PURPLE_TEAM_DATABASE_URL`` exists
  to allow — gets no default privilege here at all.

The observable failure is a service that starts, connects, and answers every
query with ``permission denied for table purple_team_executions``. So the chain grants
what its own tables need rather than depending on another chain having run.

Grants, not ownership: an owner can ``ALTER TABLE … NO FORCE ROW LEVEL
SECURITY``, which is the bypass 061 exists to close. ``aisoc_app`` therefore
gets ``SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`` and not ``TRUNCATE``, ``REFERENCES`` or
``TRIGGER``.

The role name is a literal because it has to match 061, the compose stack and
every deployment surface, and a role interpolated into DDL from an environment
variable is an injection site with no upside. A deployment using a different
runtime role issues the equivalent grant itself; the guard below makes this
revision a notice rather than a failure there.
