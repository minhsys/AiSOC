"""Read the indicators this service has collected.

Why this route exists
---------------------
The console ships a `/threat-intel` page that calls
``GET /api/v1/threat-intel/indicators``. Nothing implemented it. The page was
recently caught rendering five invented IOCs and a hard-coded "3 Added Today"
counter on tenants that had never ingested one; removing the fabrication left
the page correct and empty, because the real feed was in the `full` profile and
the endpoint it wanted did not exist in any profile. The missing feed and the
fabrication were one hole.

``services/threatintel`` and Qdrant now ship in CORE, and the CISA Known
Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog is authoritative, public and needs no API
key — so a default ``make up`` collects real indicators. This route serves
them, and the API proxies it.

Why Qdrant and not OpenSearch
-----------------------------
``ThreatIntelPipeline`` writes to three sinks. OpenSearch is the full-text one
and stays in the `full` profile; Qdrant is the one CORE has, it already carries
the complete IOC payload on every point, and ``tenant_scope_filter`` already
expresses the read scope this route needs — public feed intel under the
``shared`` sentinel, private intel under its owning tenant. Serving from the
store that is actually present is what makes the page work in CORE.

Scrolling a vector store is an unusual list path, and it is bounded on purpose:
``limit`` is capped, and this is a browse surface, not an export.
