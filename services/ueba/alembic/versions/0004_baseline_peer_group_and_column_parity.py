"""Bring the UEBA tables back in line with the models that read them.

Revision ID: 0004
Revises: 0003
Create Date: 2026-09-24

``0001`` and ``app/models/ueba.py`` disagreed in three places, and every one of
them was reached on the first scoreable event rather than on some rare path:

``ueba_entity_baselines.peer_group_id``
    Declared by :class:`~app.models.ueba.EntityBaseline`, created by no
    migration. SQLAlchemy names every mapped column in its ``SELECT``, so
    ``BaselineService.get_or_create`` — the first database call
    ``score_event`` makes — raised ``UndefinedColumnError``. UEBA could
    therefore never write a baseline or an anomaly, on any deployment, and
    the container stayed healthy throughout.

``ueba_peer_groups.id``
    Created as ``UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()``, declared as
    ``String(64)``, and written with values like ``dept:engineering`` — the
    ids are externally-supplied group names, not surrogate keys, which is
    why ``PeerGroupService.get_or_create`` passes one explicitly. An insert
    raised ``InvalidTextRepresentation``. The column follows the model
    because the model matches the data; a UUID here would mean the caller
    could not look a group up by the name it knows it by.

``ueba_anomalies.event_type``
    ``String(64)`` in the table against ``String(128)`` in the model, so an
    event type between the two lengths passed every test and failed at
    insert time in production. Widened to the declared length rather than
    narrowing the model, which would only move the failure.

The remaining differences are the harmless direction — ``observation_count``,
``created_at`` and ``z_scores`` exist in the tables and are not mapped — and
are recorded as such in ``scripts/check_orm_migration_parity.py`` rather than
dropped. A column the models never name costs a default and nothing else;
removing it would be an irreversible change made for tidiness.
