"""The agents service reaches the API as a service, for one named tenant.

Fix pass item 1.1. See `plans/aisoc_fix_pass_plan.plan.md`.

What was wrong
--------------
Three agent tool modules authenticated with `AISOC_AGENTS_API_KEY`
(`app/tools/customer_tools.py`, `app/hunt/agent.py`, `app/tools/sandbox.py`),
and **no compose file, `.env.example` or Helm value delivered that key**. On a
default `make up` every one of them answered "could not check", which a model
reads as a gap in visibility and an operator never sees.

Setting the key would not have fixed it. One key belongs to one tenant, so
every tenant's investigation would read that tenant's estate. And the routes
these tools call require `actions:read`, `lake:query` and `hunts:read`, none of
which is in `VALID_SCOPES`, so only a `*` key could reach them at all.

Why the offline suites did not catch it
---------------------------------------
They stub `_call`, or they drive the route with a `CurrentUser` built in the
test. Neither reaches the question this file asks, which is whether the
credential the deployment actually hands the agents container is one the API
will accept, and whether it confines the answer to one tenant.

What this file asserts
----------------------
The real `create_application()` against real Postgres with every migration
applied, driven over a real `httpx` client, using exactly the credential
`docker-compose.yml` gives the agents container:

* a service token plus `X-AiSOC-Tenant-ID` is accepted, and
* it returns that tenant's connectors and never the other tenant's.

The negative controls are what stop those passing for the wrong reason: a
surface that answered everything to everyone, or one that answered an empty
list to everyone, would satisfy a naive "B is present" assertion. So this also
asserts that no credential is refused, that a service token with **no** tenant
header is refused rather than widened, and that a tenant header naming a
tenant that does not exist is refused.

Against the pre-fix tree every positive assertion here fails with 401, because
the API had no service-caller path at all.
