"""Every API-to-connectors call carries the service token and the tenant.

Fix pass item 1.2. See `plans/aisoc_fix_pass_plan.plan.md`.

What was wrong
--------------
`services/connectors/app/api/router.py` mounts its whole router behind
`Depends(require_console_or_service_auth)`. A bearer credential is mandatory,
and a *service* token must additionally declare the tenant it acts for,
because an absent scope there is an empty scope rather than every scope.

Two callers in `services/api` sent neither:

* `federated.py` posted the unified query with `client.post(url, json=payload)`,
  so federated search, the agent's federated tool and the retro-hunt SIEM sweep
  were answered **401 by every SIEM**.
* `case_fanout.py` pushed cases and polled their status the same way.

The catalog proxy twenty lines away in `connectors.py` already did it
correctly, which is the shape worth noting: one call site was fixed when this
was last found, and its siblings kept shipping.

Why the offline suites did not catch it
---------------------------------------
They mock the connectors service with a transport that answers whatever it is
asked. A fake that never authenticates cannot notice a caller that never
authenticates.

Why this lives here and not in `services/api/tests/`
-----------------------------------------------------
It needs **both** services installed: the API's `_query_one_backend` on one
side and the connectors application on the other. `ci.yml`'s API job installs
only the API's lockfile, so the first home for this file errored there with
`ModuleNotFoundError: apscheduler`. `tests/isolation/` is where a test that
spans two services belongs, and `agent-auth-live.yml` installs both.

Why this runs the far side in a subprocess
------------------------------------------
Both services name their top-level package `app`. Importing the connectors
router into this suite shadows the API's own package, and the first attempt at
this file resolved `app.api.v1` inside the connectors tree, where it does not
exist. Making the test skip around that would have been worse than not writing
it: a skipping test reports the same word as a passing one.

So the real connectors application is started as its own process on a loopback
socket, and the request crosses a real one. That is also closer to the
deployment, where these are two containers.

What this file asserts
----------------------
A request built by the API's own `_catalog_headers` helper is **accepted** by
the real `require_console_or_service_auth` dependency; the same request with
the credential or the tenant removed is **refused**.

Against the pre-fix tree the first assertion fails with 401, which is what
every federated search returned on every deployment.
