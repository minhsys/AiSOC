"""The backtest's lake fetch, proven against a real ClickHouse.

The claim is: *a candidate detection can be backtested over historical lake
data before promotion, and it sees only the backtesting tenant's history.*
Everything below exists to make the second half of that provable rather than
asserted.

Why this test is shaped the way it is
-------------------------------------

``fetch_lake_events`` was the one step of the backtest with no coverage at
all. Its own unit suite says so in its docstring, and the claim-to-gate row
said the live fetch was "exercised by the integration gate" — no gate ran it.
So the three things it does were all unproven against a warehouse:

* ``rewrite_for_tenant`` injects the tenant predicate. This is the only thing
  standing between a backtest and another tenant's history, and this
  repository has a recorded scar exactly here: sqlglot 27 renamed the
  ``SELECT``'s FROM argument key, the rewriter's table walk found nothing, and
  every single-table query came back with no tenant predicate, no allowlist
  check and no table-function ban — reported as success, with every offline
  suite green. A rendered SQL string cannot tell you whether rows crossed.
* the ``window_days`` and ``limit`` clamps bound what a backtest reads. Both
  were checked by substring against a generated string, which is the assertion
  that survives a rewriter that silently drops the clause.
* ``rows_to_events`` maps lake columns onto the event dicts the rule engine
  matches. Asserting that against a hand-written column list is circular, and
  it was: the list named a ``raw_data`` column, ``aisoc.raw_events`` has no
  such column, and the payload expansion the docstring promises had therefore
  never run on a real lake row.

So no part of the chain below is re-implemented here:

* the table is created from ``services/api/clickhouse/001_init.sql``, the DDL
  a deployment actually runs;
* the rows come from ``lake_writer.event_to_row``, the only function in
  production that writes to ``aisoc.raw_events``;
* the read is the production ``fetch_lake_events``, which reaches the real
  rewriter and the real ``execute_lake_query``, settings singleton and all.

Refusing to pass vacuously
--------------------------

A test that reads zero rows and then asserts "no other tenant's rows" passes
trivially, which would make this file worse than nothing. Three guards:

* every seeded row is counted back out of the warehouse before anything is
  asserted about scoping, and the fixture fails if the writer refused an event;
* the *unscoped* form of the very same statement is executed alongside the
  scoped one and asserted to return both tenants, so the scoped result is
  known to be a filter rather than an empty partition;
* ``BACKTEST_LAKE_LIVE_REQUIRED=1`` turns an unreachable warehouse into a
  failure. ``isolation-live.yml`` sets it, so the job cannot go green by
  skipping. Without it the file skips with the host named, the way the rest of
  this directory does, so a local run stays usable.

Every module is loaded by path and unregistered afterwards, because
``services/api``, ``services/agents`` and ``services/fusion`` all package
their code as a top-level ``app`` and only one of them can own that name in
one interpreter. Putting ``services/api`` on ``sys.path`` was tried first and
it works for this file while breaking ``test_route_auth_default_deny.py`` ten
tests later with ``No module named 'app.api.contextual'`` — the API's ``app``
stays cached in ``sys.modules`` and the agents service never gets to load its
own. Each file in ``isolation-live.yml`` is its own pytest invocation, so CI
would not have shown it; ``pytest tests/isolation`` would.
