"""The production graph reader, against a live Neo4j.

Maturity: the evidence that takes **Entity graph (Neo4j)** to Stable.
See `docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md` for what the label requires.

Why this exists when `test_live_stores.py` already touches Neo4j
----------------------------------------------------------------
That test writes its own Cypher and asserts a tenant-scoped `MATCH`
behaves. It proves the *pattern* is sound, and it has a real negative
control. What it does not do is call anything a deployment runs: if
`graph_service.get_entity_neighbors` stopped binding `tenant_id`
tomorrow, that test would still pass.

That is not hypothetical. The docstring on `get_entity_neighbors` records
exactly that defect — the function accepted `tenant_id`, never bound it,
and any authenticated user could read any other tenant's host, user or
IOC node with all of its properties by naming the id. The unit tests for
it assert on Cypher *text* through a `_FakeSession`, so they would have
passed too; a text assertion cannot notice that a parameter is missing
from the call.

So every query below comes from `services/api/app/services/graph_service.py`
and runs through `app.db.neo4j.get_session`, which is the driver a
deployment uses. Nothing here re-implements a query.

The negative control
--------------------
`test_an_unscoped_read_sees_both_tenants` seeds two tenants and proves an
unscoped read returns both. Without it, every scoped assertion below
could pass against an empty graph and prove nothing — the vacuous-pass
shape this repository has caught in gates five separate times.
