"""Scheduled hunts read the tenant's own events, not a fixture.

Maturity: parity 6.1, and part of what takes the **68-hunt YAML
library** off Alpha.

Lives in its own file rather than beside the lake suite because both
services call their package `app`: running from `services/api` resolves
`app.hunt` to nothing. Two services, one module name, so one suite each.

What was wrong
--------------
The only implemented telemetry provider was `synthetic`, so every
scheduled hunt on every deployment ran against
`services/agents/tests/eval_data/synthetic_telemetry.jsonl`. The hunts
produced findings about events no customer had, and found nothing about
the events they did. `ingest` existed as a name and returned an empty
list.

The rule the replacement is built on
--------------------------------------
An unreachable lake returns nothing and says so. There is no fallback to
the fixture. A scheduled hunt that quietly reports findings from
synthetic telemetry is worse than one that reports nothing, because an
operator cannot tell the two apart and one of them is fabricated data
presented as their own estate.
