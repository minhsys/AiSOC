"""KEV exposure answers from scanner data, end to end, against real Postgres.

Fix pass item 5.2. See `plans/aisoc_fix_pass_plan.plan.md`.

What was wrong
--------------
`asset_vulnerabilities` had one writer: `POST /api/v1/assets/vulnerabilities`,
a route a human calls by hand. The Tenable connector -- the only vulnerability
scanner AiSOC integrates -- modelled its findings as alerts, so for any tenant
whose vulnerability data came from a scanner the table was empty.

`_tenant_has_vulnerability_data` exists precisely to tell "you are not exposed"
apart from "nobody has told me what you run". With an empty table it returned
the second, so KEV exposure reported **no data forever**, however many findings
had been polled.

What this file asserts
----------------------
The whole chain against real Postgres with every migration applied: a tenant
starts with no vulnerability data and `check_exposure` says so; the connector's
findings are synced; and the same call now reports the tenant exposed to the
KEV CVE, naming the asset.

The negative control is the half that makes the result mean anything: a tenant
with data who is *not* running the vulnerable thing must come back **not
exposed**, which is a different answer from "no data" and the whole reason the
distinction exists.
