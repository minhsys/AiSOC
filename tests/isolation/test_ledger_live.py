"""The Investigation Ledger, against the Postgres it writes to.

Maturity: part of the evidence that takes **AI triage + Investigation
Ledger** to Stable.
See `docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md` for what the label requires.

Why the offline test is not enough
------------------------------------
`services/agents/tests/test_ledger_tenant.py` drives a `_FakeConn` and
opens no connection. It is a reasonable test of `_resolve_tenant_id`'s
branching and it cannot prove the three things the ledger is for:

* **the rows exist** — an audit trail is a claim about a table, and a
  double that returns whatever it is asked cannot have one;
* **RLS applies** — `_set_rls_context` sets a session variable that a
  policy reads. A fake has no policies, so the call is unobserved; and
  the policy reads `app.current_tenant_id`, which something in this tree
  has already got wrong once by setting `app.tenant_id` instead;
* **the foreign keys hold** — an event referencing a run that does not
  exist should be refused, and only a real schema refuses it.

The ledger is the surface an auditor reads. "Every agent decision is
logged to a persistent ledger" is a claim about durability, and
durability is exactly the property a fake cannot stand in for.

The negative control
--------------------
`test_an_unknown_tenant_resolves_to_none` is what stops the write tests
passing for a trivial reason: a resolver that returned the same tenant
for any input would satisfy every "the row is mine" assertion here.
