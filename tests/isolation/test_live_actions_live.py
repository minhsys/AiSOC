"""Governed response actions, against a real HTTP vendor.

Maturity: the evidence that takes **Governed response actions** to
Stable.
See `docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md` for what the label requires.

What Stable asserts for a governed capability
-----------------------------------------------
Not that the product acts on its own. Response actions require a human
approver by design, and that is a safety posture rather than an
incomplete implementation. What Stable asserts is that **the governance
machinery is proven — including that it correctly refuses**.

So this suite has two halves, and the refusing half matters more:

* an action the policy permits reaches the vendor and comes back
  `executed`;
* an action the policy refuses does **not** reach the vendor, and says
  which of `pending_approval`, `blocked`, `simulated` or `dry_run` it
  was.

Why a socket rather than a mock
---------------------------------
Signatures drift silently here, and the reason is specific: simulation
mode never constructs the client, so a wrong argument name is invisible
until a real call is made. `SearchSIEMExecutor` passed `max_results=`
when the client takes `max_count`, and `CreateNotableEventExecutor`
passed `title`/`description`/`fields` when it takes `event_data` — every
live call raised `TypeError`, and every test passed.

A mock accepts whatever it is handed. A real HTTP server does not get
called at all when the client fails to construct, which is exactly the
signal that was missing.

The vendor is a stub because this is not a test of any vendor's API. It
is a socket, so the client, its auth headers and its JSON handling are
all on the path.
