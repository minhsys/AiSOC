"""Live-Postgres proof that the `mssp_*` policies isolate two MSSP portfolios.

Why this is a separate file from ``test_postgres_rls.py``
---------------------------------------------------------
That suite discovers tables by looking for a column literally named
``tenant_id``. Every ``mssp_*`` table names its tenants differently —
``parent_tenant_id`` and ``child_tenant_id``, or ``parent_id`` and
``child_id`` — so **all seven were invisible to it**, and its coverage
figure was a statement about the tables it could see. That blind spot is
the reason six of them carried no policy for as long as they did.

They also cannot be asserted the same way. A normal row belongs to one
tenant and the test is ``scoped read returns A's row, never B's``. An MSSP
row joins two tenants and *both* must read it: a policy naming only the
parent would hide from a customer the overrides applied to their own
detections, which is the transparency the adoption flow was rebuilt around.
So the assertion is "exactly one of the two seeded rows, from four different
directions, and zero from a fifth tenant that is party to neither".

The defect this would have caught
---------------------------------
Writing the pack and assignment policies as mutual subqueries is the
obvious way to express "a pack is visible to anyone it is assigned to" and
"an assignment is visible to the owning pack's parent". Both are true
statements; together they are unusable, and Postgres answers ``infinite
recursion detected in policy for relation "mssp_rule_packs"`` on the first
SELECT. ``check_rls_policy_shape.py`` passed throughout, because the shape
was right. Only running them found it.

Skips when no database answers, so a local ``pytest tests/isolation`` stays
green — but cannot skip where it is meant to run: ``integration.yml`` sets
``POSTGRES_RLS_ISOLATION_REQUIRED=1`` and an unreachable database is then a
failure, because a gate that quietly declines to run looks exactly like one
that ran and found nothing.
