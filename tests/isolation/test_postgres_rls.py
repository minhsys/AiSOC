"""Live-Postgres proof that the row-level security policies actually isolate.

Why this file exists
--------------------
Of 95 tenant-scoped tables, 31 carried an RLS policy and 64 did not, so on two
thirds of the schema the query predicate was the only thing between two
customers. ``services/api/migrations/060_rls_coverage.sql`` closes that. A
migration that adds 49 policies is worth exactly as much as the evidence that
they filter, so this is the evidence.

Shape of every assertion, borrowed from ``test_live_stores.py`` and
``services/api/tests/test_mssp_portfolio_isolation.py`` because it is what
makes such a test mean anything:

1. Seed a row for tenant A **and** a row for tenant B.
2. Assert an unscoped read sees both — a scoped read that returns nothing on an
   empty table passes for the wrong reason, and that is the failure mode this
   step exists to prevent.
3. Assert the tenant-A-scoped read returns A's row and never B's.

Read as the role the deployment actually ships
----------------------------------------------
A superuser, or any role with BYPASSRLS, ignores policies even under FORCE ROW
LEVEL SECURITY. Until ``061_runtime_app_role.sql`` every service ran as
``POSTGRES_USER=aisoc``, which the postgres image creates as a superuser, so
every policy in this database was bypassed — and this suite compensated by
building its own ``NOSUPERUSER NOBYPASSRLS`` role to read as. That made the
green ticks below a statement about a role nothing ran as.

So the role under test is now ``DATABASE_URL``: whatever the deployment
connects as. ``DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`` (the owner) is used only for seeding,
which needs DDL-adjacent privileges the runtime role deliberately lacks.
``test_the_shipped_role_does_not_bypass_rls`` asserts the distinction is real
before anything else is measured, so a deployment that collapses the two roles
fails here rather than passing vacuously.

Skips when no database answers, so a local ``pytest tests/isolation`` stays
green — but **cannot** skip where it is supposed to run. ``integration.yml``
sets ``POSTGRES_RLS_ISOLATION_REQUIRED=1`` and an unreachable database is then
a failure. A gate that quietly declines to run looks identical to one that
passed.
