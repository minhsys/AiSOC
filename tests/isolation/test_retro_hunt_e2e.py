"""A published indicator, through Kafka, into a sweep of recorded data.

Maturity: completes the **Retro-hunts when new intel arrives** row. The
plan asked to "drive one E2E from the real threatintel feed through
Kafka to an alert", and the two existing suites each cover one half:
`test_retro_hunt_live.py` drives the sweep against ClickHouse, and
`test_retro_hunt_consumer_live.py` drives the parser against a broker.
Neither crosses the seam.

What the seam is for
----------------------
The claim is "when new intel arrives, AiSOC goes back and looks". Three
things have to line up for that to be true, and they are owned by
different modules:

1. the **feed** publishes an indicator in the envelope the consumer
   expects — a shape mismatch here is silent, because the parser treats
   anything that is not `NEW_IOC` as somebody else's message;
2. the **broker** delivers it;
3. the **sweep** finds the tenant whose recorded events hold it, and
   only that tenant.

Each half passing says nothing about the join. The envelope in
particular is the kind of contract that drifts: the first version of the
consumer suite produced a flat payload and the parser correctly returned
`None`, which reads identically to "no intel arrived".

The feed is real
------------------
The indicator comes from `services/threatintel`'s own CISA KEV client
shape rather than a hand-written dict, so a change to what the feed
publishes fails here rather than at a customer.

The negative control
--------------------
`test_an_indicator_nobody_has_matches_nothing` is what makes the match
meaningful: a sweep that returned every tenant for every indicator would
satisfy the positive case.
