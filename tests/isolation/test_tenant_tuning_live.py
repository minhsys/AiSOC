"""A tenant's tuning read out of Postgres and applied by the real engine.

Maturity: the evidence that takes **Per-tenant detection tuning in the
live engine** to Stable.
See `docs/audit/MATURITY_DEFINITION.md` for what the label requires.

Why a live read matters more here than almost anywhere
-------------------------------------------------------
`OverlayCache._fetch` returns `None` when it cannot read, and the caller
turns that into the empty overlay. That fail-soft is deliberate — losing
a tenant's suppressions because the database blinked would turn their
queue back on — but it means **a permanently broken overlay is
indistinguishable from a tenant who has configured no tuning**. Both show
an engine that suppresses nothing.

That is not a hypothetical failure mode. The query selected `rule_id` and
`updated_by` from `detection_rules`, which has neither; every execution
raised, the handler logged a warning, and the overlay loaded nothing on
every deployment. Thirty unit tests passed throughout, because they ran
against a fake that answered for whatever columns it was asked about.

The offline suite now has a schema check, but it regex-parses the
migration and compares it to a regex over the module's own source: text
against text, never a connection. This file opens one.

The negative control
--------------------
`test_an_untuned_tenant_still_fires` is the half that makes the rest
mean something. Every suppression assertion here would also pass against
an engine that fires nothing at all.
