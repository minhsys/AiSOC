"""Tests for `scripts/check_dependency_pins.py`.

A gate is only worth its runtime if it fails when the property it claims to
enforce is broken. Two failure shapes this repository has actually shipped are
guarded against here:

* a **one-directional** gate that compares A to B and never B to A, so drift in
  the direction things change slips past while the gate prints OK;
* a gate that resolves its repository root from its own file location and
  prints a confident OK about a tree it never opened.

So every test below injects drift into a throwaway tree and asserts the gate
both fails *and* names the right direction. The gate carries the same
injections in `--self-test`, which runs in CI; these tests additionally pin the
behaviour of the pieces (`normalise`, `satisfies`, the tokeniser) that decide
whether an injection is seen at all.
