"""A detection rule's id must not depend on where it sits in a list.

Rule ids were positional — ``det-{category}-{index}`` — so inserting a rule
anywhere but the end renumbered every rule after it. Re-running the generator
on a clean checkout reassigned ids and tripped the marketplace gate, and the
workaround was "append new rules, never insert", which is a rule nobody
remembers and nothing enforced.

A renumbered id is not a cosmetic problem. Ids appear in alert rows, in
suppression priors and in customer-written exceptions; reassigning one makes
a historical alert reference a different rule than the one that fired.
