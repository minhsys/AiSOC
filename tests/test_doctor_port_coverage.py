"""`make doctor` must pre-flight every port CORE actually publishes.

`up` runs `doctor.sh --ports-only` before compose for one reason, written in
the Makefile: compose reports a conflict as ``Bind for 127.0.0.1:5432 failed:
port is already allocated`` against whichever container lost the race, which
names neither the process holding the port nor what to do about it, and by
then half the stack is running.

A pre-flight that covers some of the ports still lets that happen, and it did.
The list held six entries and CORE publishes sixteen. The missing one that
matters most was **11434**: CORE gained a bundled Ollama, and the single most
likely conflict for a product whose pitch is "runs a local model" is an
operator who already has Ollama installed. Measured on a host in exactly that
state, `make up` passed the port check and the model the stack pulled was not
the model answering on that port.

So the gate is two-directional, because a one-directional one is how the list
went stale in the first place:

* every CORE-published host port must appear in the doctor's list, and
* every port in the doctor's list must still be published by CORE, so an
  entry does not linger after a service is removed or remapped.

`make doctor` does not read the profile, so `full`-profile ports are out of
scope here — checking a port for a service that is not starting would fail a
deployment over a conflict that cannot occur.
