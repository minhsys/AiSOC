"""The placeholder detector and the file it inspects must not drift apart.

`scripts/doctor.sh` carried this check inline for a long time::

    grep -qE '^[A-Z_]*(SECRET|PASSWORD|KEY)=(change_me|changeme|)$' .env

and `.env.example` shipped
``AISOC_CREDENTIAL_KEY=replace-me-with-a-freshly-generated-fernet-key`` and
``SECRET_KEY=change-this-to-a-random-secret-key-at-least-32-chars``. The grep
matched neither. So the gate built to catch a shipped placeholder reported
clean on the one ``.env`` that broke the product — following the documented
``cp .env.example .env`` produced an API that answered HTTP 500 on every
connector save, while *skipping* the documented step produced a working one.

Two lists maintained by hand and compared by nothing. These tests compare them,
in both directions:

* every value ``.env.example`` ships is either flagged by the detector or named
  below as a deliberate working default, so a new placeholder cannot be added
  without teaching the detector about it;
* the historical placeholder strings still match, so the detector cannot be
  narrowed back to the shape that missed them;
* the three secrets ``scripts/ensure_env.py`` generates are shipped **empty**,
  because empty is the only value the credential vault treats as "not
  configured" and therefore the only safe thing to ship.
