"""First-run defects that every test suite passed and a real deployment did not.

A live acceptance pass brought the CORE stack up from the published images,
ran the golden pipeline green, and then could not log in. Three separate
things had to be wrong at once for that to happen, and none of them was
visible to a unit test:

* migration 001 seeded `admin@aisoc.local`, an RFC 6761 special-use domain
  that `pydantic.EmailStr` rejects with a 422 before the password is compared;
* it seeded a bcrypt hash whose plaintext nobody knew, while four
  documentation pages published `changeme` for it;
* the published `aisoc-web:latest` image — the one `docker-compose.yml`
  pulls — was built with `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true`, and Next inlines that
  at build time, so a self-hoster's console called their real alerts demo
  data with no runtime way out.

Each check below is a file-content assertion because each defect lived in the
gap *between* files: a migration and a doc, a Dockerfile and a workflow. The
behavioural coverage is in `services/api/tests/test_bootstrap_admin.py`.
