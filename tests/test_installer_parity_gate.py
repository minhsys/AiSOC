"""The two installers must start the same product and prove it the same way.

`install.sh` was changed to bring up the real stack with `make up`, create an
administrator and run the golden pipeline. `install.ps1` was not, and nothing
noticed for a release: it kept handing off to `pnpm aisoc:demo`, a compose
file with no ingest service, no fusion service and Kafka disabled, whose only
content came from a seed script writing rows straight into Postgres — and
then printed "AiSOC is up and running." A Windows evaluator saw a populated
console and concluded the platform worked, having never run the platform.

Nothing could catch that, because the two installers share no code and the
Windows one exercised no path CI ran. The checks below are file-content
assertions for exactly that reason: the defect lived in the gap between two
files that are supposed to agree and have no mechanism forcing them to.

Windows has no `make`, so install.ps1 cannot call the Makefile and the
comparison cannot be "does it run the same command line". What it can be, and
is, is "does it run the same *underlying* commands" — the ones the Makefile's
`up`, `bootstrap` and `smoke` targets run — plus the narrower class of bug
that shipped alongside: a script telling the user to run a file that is not
in the repository.
