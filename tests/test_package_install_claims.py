"""A package README must not imply an install command that cannot resolve.

None of the eight first-party packages has ever been uploaded. The release
workflow's publish jobs reported **success** anyway, because only the final
upload step is credential-gated and the repository's sole secret is
`FLY_API_TOKEN` — so each job ran, skipped the upload, and went green. Asking
the registries is the only way to know: all eight return 404.

That is a deliberate, documented state and not a defect. The defect is what
the READMEs said about it. Four of them offered the install command under the
heading `v8.0+ (once <package> lands on PyPI)`, and v8.0 shipped four major
versions ago — so by v12 the label read as "this should already work" rather
than "not yet". A reader runs it, gets `No matching distribution found`, and
concludes the project is broken.

This gate holds the two together: for every package that is *not* on its
registry, the README that advertises it must say so in the present tense. If
a package is later published, the gate stops requiring the disclaimer for it
rather than needing to be edited — so publishing cannot leave a stale "not
yet" behind either.

The package list, the registry query and the accepted wording all come from
`scripts/check_published_packages.py`, which reads
`.github/release-packages.yml`. This file used to carry its own copy of all
three, covering five of the eight packages — two descriptions of the same
fact, free to drift, and drifted: `aisoc`, `@aisoc/mcp` and `aisoc-detections`
were never checked here at all, and `packages/aisoc-lite/README.md` was
advertising `npx aisoc triage --demo` with no caveat as a result.
