"""`make up` resolves a port conflict instead of refusing to start.

The friction this removes
--------------------------
`make up` used to stop dead when any one of sixteen host ports was taken,
and tell the operator to go edit `docker-compose.yml`. That is a hard stop
at step one of the documented quick start, triggered by the most common
condition in this audience's environment: a Postgres already on 5432, or
an Ollama already on 11434 — and the reader of that README is exactly the
person who has one.

Refusing beat the alternative at the time. Compose reports `Bind for
127.0.0.1:NNNN failed` against whichever container lost the race, half a
stack later. But the right answer to "that port is busy" is to use a
different one and say so, not to stop.

The two bugs this file pins, both found while building it
----------------------------------------------------------
**`SO_REUSEADDR` made the probe more permissive than the real bind.** With
it set, binding `127.0.0.1:5432` *succeeds* while another container holds
`0.0.0.0:5432`, so the detector reported the single most common conflict
as free. A probe easier to satisfy than the thing it predicts is worse
than no probe.

**`$(wildcard)` in a `:=` variable is evaluated when make parses the
file**, which is before the target that writes the overlay has run. The
first `make up` on a conflicting host therefore generated the overlay
correctly and then started compose without it, failing on exactly the
bind it had just resolved.
