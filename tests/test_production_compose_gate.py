"""`docker-compose.prod.yml` must be production by construction.

Discussion #629 reported that the deployment page pointed at a production
compose file that did not exist, so the only stack an operator could start was
the development one — where `ENVIRONMENT` defaults to `development`,
`development` is in `AUTH_BYPASS_ENVIRONMENTS`, and `dev_auth.py` resolves an
unauthenticated request to a demo user whose role is `admin`.

A file that merely *documents* the right settings would have the same problem
one release later. These assertions are about the file rather than the docs:
the bypass must be unreachable, no service may start on a credential published
in this repository, and no datastore may be bound to the host.

Every assertion is run against `docker-compose.yml` as well, which must fail
them. That is what distinguishes these from a test that would pass on an empty
file.
