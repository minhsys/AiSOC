"""The README figures gate must actually catch drift.

The README quoted 947 executable detection rules while the generated truth
table said 833, and 62 GATED claims while the matrix held 72. Both survived
review because nothing compared the front page to the artifact it was
summarising. These tests pin that comparison down: a gate that only ever
passes is indistinguishable from no gate.
