"""The reliability harness must measure the settings production actually uses.

``scripts/measure_triage_reliability.py`` published a measured reliability
figure for auto-triage — 44 of 50 replies usable before constraining the reply
to a JSON object, 50 of 50 after. That number only describes production while
the harness runs production's settings, and the harness holds its own copies of
them as module constants.

The script's comment already said they "are asserted against it in
tests/test_triage_reliability_harness.py". The file did not exist, so the
constants were free to drift from the call site and the published figure would
have quietly started describing a configuration nobody runs. Reading both out
of the tree and comparing them is what the comment claimed all along.

Parsed rather than imported: ``auto_triage_agent`` pulls in the agents service's
dependency tree, which is not installed for the repository-level gates, and a
test that skips when an import fails is a test that stops running the day the
environment changes.
